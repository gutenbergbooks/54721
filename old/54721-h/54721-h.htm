<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="foreword"></a>Publishers' Foreword</h2>

</div>

<p>This book was planned before Food Conservation was
by the mass considered seriously. The writers of the
various articles are thoroughly qualified to speak where
they have spoken. They are practical, conscientious,
Christian, and have at heart the best in the needs of humanity.
Every one strikes a major chord in the song
of healthful, economical living. The recipes are from the
author of "Food and Cookery," who has had a score of
years' experience in every station and phase of the preparation
of food, under French, English, German, and
Spanish chefs. He has been second cook in the Calumet
Club of Chicago, the California Club, Los Angeles, and
in many leading hotels in various cities. For ten years,
he has given his best thought and study to the preparation
of the best in food, scientific, palatable, wholesome,
and economic, most of this time in the Sanitarium and
College of Medical Missionaries, Loma Linda, California.
Special attention is called to the valuable tables of Food
Elements, and to the newly demonstrated values of vitamines
and the substances which destroy them.</p>

<p>We are grateful for the kind word spoken by Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, president of Stanford University, and
first assistant to Mr. Hoover in the Federal Food Administration
Department; also for the help and suggestions
of Dr. Newton Evans, president of the College of
Medical Evangelists, of Loma Linda, California.</p>

<p>The little book will, we believe, not only meet present
needs, but be a safe counselor in the years to come.</p>

To provide adequate supplies for the coming year is of
absolutely vital importance to the conduct of the war; and
without a very conscientious elimination of waste and very
strict economy in our food consumption, we cannot hope to
fulfill this primary duty."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="food"></a>FOOD ECONOMY</h2>

</div>

<p class="center bold large"><i>by<br />
E. A. SUTHERLAND, A. B., M. D.</i><br />
of the State Bureau of<br />
Food Conservation of Tennessee</p>

<p>From the days of ancient Egypt, when Joseph, who
stood at the head of the great food conservation movement
of the time, called the attention of the world to the need
of food economy, down through history to the present
time, the human race has passed through numerous crises
when the questions of food production and food economy
have been vital. That Hebrew, promoted to the first place
in the Egyptian empire because of his wonderful grasp of
a world problem and his executive ability, enabled that
kingdom to feed the world. America to-day, as Egypt
of old, is an international granary, and is asked to feed
the nations; and her population&mdash;every man, woman, and
child&mdash;must co&#246;perate with America's Joseph to-day in
meeting the situation by proper production, proper conservation,
and strict economy. "This war is a food war
even more than it is a gun war." Let us fight to save
lives. That is the battle to be won through food economy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">Pg 8</a></span></p>

<p>It was when the Roman world was running riot that,
on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, Christ gave His wonderful
lesson on the subject of food conservation. We
call it a miracle when with five thousand men, besides
the women and the children, seated about Him, He fed
the multitudes. That same power is to-day, and always
has been, feeding the men of earth. From a basket of
seed, each recurring harvest puts thousands of loaves of
bread into the hands of the world's hungry; the two small
fishes continue to multiply; rich and poor alike are fed
by the great Provider. And now as then, after human
wants are met, the mandate goes forth, "Gather up the
fragments that remain, that nothing be lost." Economy
is again being preached as it was once taught on the
shores of Galilee. There has been started a great educational
movement for increased food production. But
that is only a part of the message. "Gather up the
fragments," prevent waste, utilize the scraps, the gospel
of a clean plate,&mdash;these are all familiar phrases in the
great conservation movement of to-day. By many, food
conservation and food economy are deemed not only national
problems, but a part of the divine message taught
by Christ and His disciples.</p>

<p>The great world war which began in 1914 has compelled
every nation to halt and consider its national habits.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the United States is the most prodigal
of nations. Approximately sixty per cent of its population
is now urban. Simple rural life is practically gone;
and those artificial and extravagant standards of the city
which destroy body, mind, and soul have taken its place.
"Fullness of bread and abundance of idleness," two of
the reasons assigned by the Scriptures for the downfall
of Sodom, are conditions which to-day are ruining American
civilization. No other nation has ever indulged such
extravagance and prodigality as has the United States.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">Pg 9</a></span>
We search the world over for table delicacies. American
inventive genius has made it possible to have foods from
all parts of the world, both in season and out of season.
The arts of canning and preserving and the making of
factory foods have loaded our cupboard shelves with eatables
of which our fathers never dreamed.</p>

<p>While this interchange has its advantages, and we
should appreciate the privilege of eating the wholesome
products of other countries, yet when easy methods of
transportation lead people to limit their productions to
money crops, forsaking the raising of their own food, a
wrong principle has been introduced. The benefit to be
derived from this variety of imported food is neutralized
by the extravagant habits and tastes thus cultivated.</p>

<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Economy of Food Elements</i></p>

<p>Man is made from the dust of the earth; and by divine
law, his body continues to build and rebuild from
chemically organized soil. To be intelligent, food economists
require a knowledge of the four food elements,&mdash;proteins,
carbohydrates, fats, and minerals,&mdash;and the relation
each sustains to the human body. Later chapters
contain valuable instruction in these respects.</p>

<p>It is poor economy to allow valuable mineral salts to
be removed from flour by milling, from rice by polishing,
and from vegetables by wrong methods of cooking. These
minerals are necessary for the development of the child,
for the preservation of teeth and bones, for high efficiency
in the nervous system, and for a proper functioning of
the various organs in the body. There is no economy in
buying denatured grain, even though it is put up in cartons,
at ten times the price of the natural grain.</p>

<p>"Put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given
to appetite." Stop the immense waste of strength, energy,
money, and time due to mere gratification of appetite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">Pg 10</a></span>
Stop preparing food that is intended simply to
coax the appetite to the point where eating becomes gluttony.
In the words of an eminent authority, "Most men
would attain better health and greater efficiency if they
would reduce their rations by twenty-five per cent or
more." The celebrated Dr. Osler tells us that "we eat
too much after forty years of age," and he advises every
wise man to restrict his eating as he grows older, "and
at last descend out of life as he ascended into it, even
into a child's diet."</p>

<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Overeating</i></p>

<p>Food economy is not a call to a starvation diet, but
to a balanced ration of wholesome, well prepared food.
Overeating of even the best food produces poisons that
injure the tissues, overwork the organs of digestion, and
in time may bring the body to actual starvation conditions.</p>

<p>A man's appetite is not always a safe guide. Artificial
surroundings in childhood make the normal appetite
the exception rather than the rule. Few children
are taught, by parents, teachers, or preachers, the importance
of restricting the appetite. The seeds of intemperance
sown by those who prepare food for the
family table bring a larger harvest than does the work
of all the devil's agencies in saloons and tobacco shops
combined. Millions of dollars are worse than wasted by
the conversion of food materials into strong drinks to
satisfy appetites perverted by wrong habits of eating.
Why are our schools and churches more interested in
the maintenance of a worn-out, traditional educational
system, and an abstract, impractical religion, than in some
of these vital teachings? We look to legislation to cure
degenerate appetites for which we are largely responsible
through false education in home and school and church.
Starving ones of earth are deprived of food when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">Pg 11</a></span>
convert it into strong drink; the process requires the
time and strength of a great army of workers; and transportation
facilities now used for carrying whisky, tobacco,
and other body- and mind-destroying substances, might
be used in transporting the foods we waste. It is estimated
that we waste enough in our kitchens to feed ten
million people. "Blessed art thou, O land, when ... thy
princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!"</p>

<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Some Economies</i></p>

<p>Dr. Osler has said that "pie north of the Mason and
Dixon line, and hot bread south of it, have done more
harm than alcohol." The best breads contain the whole
grain; they are well baked, require considerable chewing,
resist the pressure of the teeth, and save dental bills.
Thorough mastication neutralizes an abnormal appetite.</p>

<p>Rich pastries, harmful condiments, tea and coffee,&mdash;narcotics
recognized as extravagant, harmful, and useless
beverages,&mdash;are being discarded for the sake of both
health and economy. Remove the cream and the sugar
from tea and coffee, and they have no food value.</p>

<p>Use the coffee mill to grind wheat, rye, and corn,
that you may enjoy the vitamines, the mineral salts, and
other elements often removed by the manufacturer.</p>

<p>Many people prominent in social circles are eliminating
all lunches served between regular meals and eaten
for merely social purposes. Such lunches impose a burden
on the body and the purse. Wealthy and influential
women are setting a good example by going to market
in person, in order to make intelligent and economical
purchases for their tables, and by carrying their supplies
home, in order to save the added cost of the delivery system.
People are beginning to realize that by such economical
methods, they can serve their country, the world,
and themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">Pg 12</a></span></p>

<p>Some have thought it necessary to eat from three to
five meals a day. The war is helping them to appreciate
a physiological truth taught for years by a few reformers,&mdash;that
two meals a day are better even than three.</p>

<p>Many countries, for economy's sake, now prohibit the
use, for food, of young and undeveloped animals. They
discourage the extensive use of immature plant foods.
The world war is terrible, yet there is some compensation
in the fact that present conditions are making minds
more susceptible to the principles of right living. For
years, some earnest men and women have been teaching
that God intended that man should live on a meatless
diet. To-day, not only are nations asking that men eat
less meat, but they are having their meatless days. Because
of the impossibility of securing flesh foods in some
countries, millions of earth's inhabitants have learned
that the body can be kept in splendid condition without
the use of animal proteins and fats. No strong arguments
are necessary to convince people that flesh foods are expensive
when it is known that ten pounds of grain suitable
for human food are required to produce in the animal
one pound of flesh food.</p>

<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Meat Substitutes</i></p>

<p>The high cost of flesh foods is turning attention to
meat substitutes. Proteins and fats of the vegetable world
are not only cheaper, but they are more wholesome than
flesh. For example: The soy bean, recently introduced
to the American table, contains, pound for pound, and at
one fifth the cost, almost twice as much available protein
and fat as the best beefsteak. Besides that, it offers the
eater a good supply of starch.</p>

<p>"We have got to learn to buy wisely, cook wisely, eat
wisely, and waste nothing." The great countries of Europe
are utilizing the best talent of their statesmen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">Pg 13</a></span>
scientists in teaching the people these ideas. This should
be a most impressive lesson to home, to church, and to
school, since these agencies have so far forgotten their
mission that it is necessary for this great war to arouse us.</p>

<p>Let religious and educational leaders redeem the time.
Let them co&#246;perate with national economists who now are
urging the people&mdash;</p>

<p>To use more home-ground flour and meal.</p>

<p>To use the natural rice with its vitamines instead of
the polished product.</p>

<p>To substitute vegetable oils for dairy butter in cooking.</p>

<p>To have a simpler variety of food at each meal.</p>

<p>To serve a dessert, when one is deemed necessary, for
its food value and as a part of a balanced ration.</p>

<p>To bake or boil potatoes in the skins, in order to preserve
the mineral salts.</p>

<p>To utilize for soups and gravies the water in which
vegetables, macaroni, and rice are boiled.</p>

<p>To serve only one food of high protein value at a meal.</p>

<p>To feed to animals nothing that can be utilized by the
human body.</p>

<p>To allow vegetables, grains, and legumes to ripen, that
their full food value may be obtained, and that the expense
of canning may be avoided.</p>

<p>To can or dry all fruits and vegetables that cannot be
preserved in any other way.</p>

<p>To substitute other cereals for wheat, which can be
shipped abroad.</p>

<p>A wheatless meal every day will drive many to appreciate
the value of other grains, whose use heretofore
has been largely perverted. Corn, rye, barley, and oats
are not appreciated as they should be. They have been
used largely in the manufacture of intoxicating drinks
and for feeding animals to procure meat. It has been said
that the Revolutionary War was won by men fed on hasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">Pg 14</a></span>
pudding&mdash;in other words, corn meal mush. Learn to
eat bread made from corn, rye, or oats, or a mixture of
these grains. Form the habit of eating these more economical
breads; then continue the practice. Such breads
are far superior to the ordinary denatured white bread.
If a dog is fed only white bread, death will result sooner
than if it is fed nothing.</p>

<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>The Call of the Country</i></p>

<p>Land in Europe that for centuries was used to gratify
the abnormal tastes of plutocrats and the aristocracy, is
now being made to produce wholesome food to meet the
world's needs. In America, people are still deprived of
their divine right to a simple home, because millions of
acres of land are held in a similar manner.</p>

<p>Schools and churches should encourage the cultivation
of vacant city lots. City people may thus learn the
secret of intensive farming. It may give some courage
to make a home on a few acres of land and to raise the
food for their own tables. Every turn in a congested
center calls for an outlay of means. Modern methods of
living are unnatural and extravagant. In the city, every
article of food costs in proportion to its distance from
the base of supplies. Transportation must be added to
the original cost of production; the jobber, the wholesaler,
the commission merchant, the retailer, the delivery man,
and the baker must all have their profits.</p>

<p>Get out of the cities; get onto the land! Why not
preach this part of the gospel? Help people to understand
that the unnatural appetites and the desires for artificial
food are penalties paid very largely by those who seek to
maintain themselves by their wits. One mighty step
has been taken toward the prevention of waste and in
economy's favor when men learn to earn their bread in
the sweat of their face while tilling the soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">Pg 15</a></span></p>

<p>Late hours, business worry, nerve-wrecking noises, the
hurry, the wear and tear of living in a crowd, the dust
and filth of the city air, the struggle of competition,&mdash;these
would be replaced by purer, saner surroundings
if parents settled in some country place where children
are born with a heritage of fresh air, grassy playgrounds,
wholesome daily tasks in the house and out of doors, and
are fed in a simple manner befitting their surroundings.
But do not transfer the evils of the city to some country
site. Not much need to urge "the gospel of the clean
plate" to the healthy country child! A good appetite is
the best seasoning for plain food.</p>

<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Permanent Reforms</i></p>

<p>The world has been roughly awakened, and forcibly
compelled to study food economy. This upheaval should
result in permanent good to every individual. We have
not fully appreciated the fact that our sinful indulgence
and our careless waste of time, money, and food is a
violation of the great commandment, "Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself." By our extravagant ways,
multitudes have been robbed of the necessities of life.
But our horizon is broadening. We begin to understand
why we should eat and drink to the glory of God. Provision
is now being made for the bread we save to reach
the hungry in distant parts of the earth. We can now
prove that he who gives even a cup of cold water shall
in no wise lose his reward. To-day, as truly as on the
shores of Galilee, the great Master is saying, "Gather up
the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost." And
if we enter whole-heartedly into this food conservation
movement, we may expect the blessing of the Lord to
rest so greatly upon the fragments saved that the wide
world will be fed.</p>

SIMPLICITY of DIET</h2>

</div>

<p class="center bold large"><i>by<br />
E. H. RISLEY, M.D.</i><br />
Chair of Chemistry, College of Medical Evangelists,<br />
Loma Linda, California</p>

<p>"Food is any substance that, being taken into the body
of animal or plant, serves, through organic action, to
build up normal structure or supply waste of tissue."</p>

<p>Food principles or elements are commonly grouped
into the following classes:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">1. Proteins</li>
<li class="isub2">2. Fats</li>
<li class="isub2">3. Carbohydrates</li>
<li class="isub2">4. Inorganic salts</li>
<li class="isub2">5. Vitamines</li>
<li class="isub2">6. Water</li>
</ul>

<p>A brief discussion of these food elements will help
our readers to select their food supply more intelligently.</p>

<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Proteins</i></p>

<p>The first class of food substances mentioned above are
of very great importance to the body. The term "protein"
really means, "of first importance." These compounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">Pg 18</a></span>
are represented by such foods as the white of egg, lean
meat, gluten of wheat, and casein of milk. Chemically,
proteins are very complex, more so than any other class
of food materials. They have in their structure the chemical
elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, often
sulphur and phosphorus, and, less commonly, iron. The
nitrogenous element seems to be the most important, since
the others mentioned can be obtained from other classes
of food; but as these classes of food cannot take the place
of protein, it seems clear that the nitrogen is the important
constituent.</p>

<p>Most proteins coagulate on heating. An illustration
of this property is the coagulation of the white of an egg
when the egg is cooked. The proteins all undergo decomposition
quite easily. This is evidenced by the ease with
which eggs and meat spoil.</p>

<p>Protein molecules are made up of smaller molecules
called amino acids. These are the "building stones" from
which the working tissues of the body are formed. There
are on the average about fifteen different kinds of these
amino acids in the proteins, which are especially valuable
in supplying building material for the tissues of
the human body. These amino acids are united in long
chains to form the protein molecule, and in this respect
can be compared to cars in a train. By the work of
digestion, the proteins are broken down into these comparatively
simple building stones, which, when absorbed
into the circulation, are used by the body in building
working tissues as they are needed.</p>

<p>There are a number of classes of proteins; but since
the classification is rather complicated, it will not be given
here. To group the various foods as to their relative
amounts of protein is often of interest. For example,
foods very rich in protein, such as the gluten preparations,
lean beef, and white of egg, may be regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">Pg 19</a></span>
the first class; a second class might be formed of those
which are moderately high in protein, such as peas, beans,
lentils, and walnuts; a third class having a moderate
amount of protein, represented by the cereals and breads;
and still a fourth class very low in protein, such as vegetables
and fruits.</p>

<p>Protein is the tissue builder of the body; but the
actual amount of tissue built new each day is very small,
therefore the need for a large supply of protein for this
purpose is not apparent. Protein not only supplies tissue-building
material, but it can also supply heat and energy
in a manner similar to the other classes of food elements,
carbohydrate and fat, one ounce of the protein yielding
one hundred sixteen calories of energy. The excess taken
in may be used in this way, as there is no storage of this
material in the body. However, to use this kind of fuel
takes more work on the part of the body as a whole, as the
nitrogenous wastes must be eliminated by the kidneys.</p>

<p>One can see, then, that a certain amount of protein is
needed to keep the tissues in good repair, but that it is
better to get most of the heat and energy from the food
elements specially designed for that purpose; that is, carbohydrate
and fat.</p>

<p>The Chittenden standard of diet gives ten per cent of
the total fuel value in the form of protein. On the basis
of two thousand five hundred total calories a day, two
hundred fifty calories of protein would be required. This
is equal to two and one seventh ounces actual dry protein.
This amount is thought by some to be low, but experimental
evidence seems clearly to prove its adequacy in
keeping up nutrition.</p>

<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Fats</i></p>

<p>The second group of food elements in our classification
are substances having a greasy feeling and taste. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">Pg 20</a></span>
are lighter than water, leave a grease spot upon paper,
are insoluble in water, and soluble in such chemicals as
gasoline and ether.</p>

<p>Fats have in their molecules the chemical elements
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These elements are put
together into two groups, or compounds, glycerin and fatty
acids, which, when chemically united, form a fat. When
fats are exposed to the open air, and thus contaminated
with bacteria, they are likely to become rancid; that is,
some of the glycerin and fatty acids are set free from
each other. If butter is the fat so decomposed, it becomes
very disagreeable, on account of the volatile butyric acid
that is set free.</p>

<p>Fatty bodies are usually grouped under a general
heading called lipins, but the consideration of the other
classes is not essential in this study.</p>

<p>The vegetable kingdom offers a large list of products
containing fats, many of which are suitable for food.
Following are a few examples, with the percentage of fat
in each case: coconuts, sixty-eight per cent; olives, fifty-six
per cent; peanuts, forty-one per cent; cotton seed,
twenty per cent; oatmeal, six per cent; corn, four per cent.</p>

<p>The animal kingdom is also rich in fat products, illustrated
by the following substances used as foods: butter,
eighty-five per cent; bacon, sixty-five per cent; cheese,
thirty per cent; eggs, eleven per cent; cow's milk, four
per cent.</p>

<p>The function of fat in the body is to yield heat and
energy primarily. Each ounce of fat yields two hundred
sixty-four calories of heat, making the group two and one
fourth times as active as either protein or carbohydrate
in this respect.</p>

<p>Fats ordinarily supply from twenty-five to thirty per
cent of the total calories of a well balanced dietary. On
the basis of two thousand five hundred total calories a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">Pg 21</a></span>
day, about seven hundred fifty should be fat. At two
hundred sixty-four calories to an ounce, we have about
three ounces as our daily need of this food element.</p>

<p>Fats are also stored in the body as a reserve of energy.
Every one has more or less of this sort of reserve, unless
he has been starving for some time, or is suffering from
a wasting disease. This reserve of fat also acts as a protection,
and gives shape and symmetry to the body.</p>

<p>Recently methods have been devised for changing the
unstable vegetable oils into stable, lardlike, solid fats.
This process is called hydrogenation, so named because
the process is really one of adding hydrogen until the fat
becomes saturated and less likely to undergo decomposition
into fatty acid and glycerin. The fats thus formed
seem to be equal to the animal fats so far as digestion
and utilization are concerned, and hence are of considerable
economic value at the present time.</p>

<p>Certain fats, including those of butter and milk, are
rich in the so-called vitamines, and have been shown, by
recent experiments upon animals, to be efficient growth
stimulants.</p>

<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Carbohydrates</i></p>

<p>The carbohydrates are made up of the chemical elements
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. By noticing the
name, one readily sees that the first part stands for the
carbon. The latter half, "hydrate," indicates that water
might be present; and in fact, nearly all of these bodies
have hydrogen and oxygen present in the proportion to
form water, that is, two parts hydrogen to one of oxygen.
Carbohydrates ordinarily make up about sixty to sixty-five
per cent of the total number of calories of our diet. Most
carbohydrates, when pure, are either white powders or
white crystalline solids. Many of them are sweet to the
taste. The starches and the celluloses are not soluble in
cold water, but the sugars are readily soluble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">Pg 22</a></span></p>

<p>The classification of the carbohydrates is comparatively
simple; and part of it is given here, as it will help
in our discussion of the properties of the group:</p>

<p><i>Cellulose</i> is the coarse woody fiber found in the stems
of all plants and in the outer coating of the various grains.
Unless cellulose is very young and tender, it is not digested
by the human digestive system. However, some forms of
it are of value, as they give bulk to the food residue in
the digestive tract, and thus stimulate the activity of the
intestinal muscle. In this way, cellulose acts as a natural
laxative, and in some cases is a very desirable substance
to have in the food eaten. The bran of wheat and other
cereals is an especially valuable form to use.</p>

<p><i>Starch</i> is found in all cereals, in many vegetables, in
some fruits, and in nuts. It occurs in these different
foods in the form of a white, granular substance. The
granules have characteristic forms for the different grains,
fruits, etc., which can be recognized by the aid of the
microscope. Raw starch is insoluble in cold water; hence
to be most readily digested, it should be cooked. The
cooking process ruptures the granules, and makes the
starch itself partially soluble; and in this form, it is
more easily attacked by the digestive juices.</p>

<p><i>Dextrin</i> is formed by heating starch to about 350&#176; F.,
as in an oven. This degree of heat changes the starch
chemically to dextrin. In this dextrin form, it is soluble,
and is in reality one step along in the process of digestion.</p>

<p>Thoroughly toasted bread is quite well dextrinized. It
is more easily digested, has a sweeter taste than ordinary
bread, and in some cases, is more desirable.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Sugar Group</i></p>

<p><i>Cane sugar</i> is probably the most important member
of the sugar groups. It is obtained from the sugar cane
and the sugar beet, the two forms being identical chemically.
It can be obtained in a high state of purity, often
up to ninety-nine and eight tenths per cent. The English-speaking
races use the largest amount of this sugar, in
some countries averaging as high as eighty-five pounds
per capita a year. Cane sugar is white, crystalline, soluble
in water, and has a very sweet taste.</p>

<p><i>Malt sugar</i> is obtained from grains, such as barley or
wheat, by allowing them to sprout. During the sprouting
process, there is developed in the grain a ferment that is
capable of changing starch to malt sugar. After the malt
diastase, as the ferment is called, has had a chance to
convert the starch to malt sugar, the sugar is extracted
with water, and the resulting solution evaporated to a
sirup. This sirup can be evaporated further and the malt
sugar or maltose taken out as a solid; but it is usually
used in the form of a sirup. This maltose is a natural
product to the body, as it is formed by the saliva and the
pancreatic juice when they act upon starch.</p>

<p><i>Milk sugar</i> is found to the extent of about five per
cent in cow's milk. It is obtained as a by-product in
the manufacture of cheese. The whey, or watery fluid
left after the removal of the curd, is evaporated and
purified until a fine, white, rather gritty powder, or in
some cases a crystalline solid, is obtained. This milk
sugar, or lactose, is soluble in water, and has a fairly
sweet taste. Lactose is one of the essential food elements
for the normal growth of a child or a young animal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">Pg 29</a></span>
Hence one can see why children cannot be reared easily
without milk.</p>

<p><i>Glucose</i> is the most important sugar in the third
group of carbohydrates as given above. It is found naturally
in many fruits, and is here called grape sugar. It
is the normal sugar of human blood, and in this connection,
is usually called dextrose. Glucose is made commercially
by boiling starch, most frequently cornstarch,
in water, to which sulphuric acid has been added up to
one to one and one half per cent. After sufficient boiling,
the acid is neutralized with lime, and the sugar separated
by chemical methods. If the process is carried out
carefully, and reasonably pure reagents are used in the
process, the result will be a sirup of fair purity and one
of value as a food. Impure and poorly made samples of
glucose have given this otherwise wholesome sugar a
bad name.</p>

<p>Glucose can also be obtained in solid form by continuing
the process of purification a few steps beyond the
sirup stage. But let it not be forgotten that any of the
sugars, taken in large amounts, may overload the digestive
system and the liver, and hence they should be used
in reasonable amounts.</p>

<p><i>Levulose</i>, called also fruit sugar, is found in some of
the sweet fruits and in bees' honey. The chief sugar of
honey is called invert sugar, and is really made up of
equal parts of dextrose and levulose. It is present up
to seventy-five per cent in good samples of honey. These
sugars, properly used, are excellent foods.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Importance of Carbohydrates</i></p>

<p>The carbohydrates are our chief source of heat and
energy, and as previously stated, furnish sixty to sixty-five
per cent of the total fuel value of our food. Each
ounce of pure carbohydrate yields one hundred sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">Pg 30</a></span>
calories of heat when burned. In caloric yield, they are
equal to the proteins gram for gram, but yield less than
one half that of the fats. If two thousand five hundred
calories are again taken as our standard, then sixty per
cent would make one thousand five hundred calories to
be furnished by the carbohydrates. At one hundred
sixteen calories an ounce, we find that it would require
thirteen ounces of pure carbohydrate a day to balance
this part of our diet.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Other Essential Elements</i></p>

<p>The inorganic salts or ash of food are just as essential
to the body as the other groups of food elements. These
essential salts consist of the most common chemical elements,
such as soda, potash, lime, magnesia, iron, phosphorus,
sulphur, etc. One might expect to find some rare
elements in a piece of mechanism as complicated as the
human body, but such is not the case. The body salts
are of the most common kinds. These salts are found
in proper amounts in foods as produced by nature. We
cannot take these salts as they are found in the chemical
laboratory and use them to good advantage, but we should
make sure that we are taking foods that will supply them
in the proper amounts. Our best sources of supply are
the grains, the fruits, and the vegetables. It is interesting
to note that these mineral elements are generally
found most abundantly, in the grains at least, in or near
the outer coating, and that our high-grade flours are
partially robbed of them when the bran and the middlings
are removed. The same seems to be true of potatoes.
In peeling, a large part of these salts is removed, and
thus the real value of this splendid food product is lessened.
This is one of the strong arguments for the use
of whole wheat flours and other whole grain products.
These inorganic salts are needed in the body to keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">Pg 31</a></span>
various tissues up to their normal in composition. For
example, the blood constantly needs some iron to build
the red cells. Though the actual amount needed is very
small, yet that small amount is exceedingly important
to have at hand.</p>

<p>As some of these salts are constantly being eliminated
from the body, there must be a constant supply to keep
the tissues in equilibrium.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Vitamines</i></p>

<p>Vitamines are elsewhere considered in this booklet,
hence only a very brief summary here. The chemistry
of these products is very little understood at present.
They were so named by Funk because of their nitrogen
content and similarity to ammonia, the name really meaning
<i>vital ammonias</i>. The term "vital" carries with it the
idea of their importance to life. Some persons have
questioned this name; but up to the present, it seems
to be the best suggested.</p>

<p>The importance of the vitamines in nutrition has been
very clearly demonstrated in experiments upon animals,
and these experiments have been repeated a sufficient
number of times to be conclusive. Animals have been
fed upon pure protein, fat, carbohydrate, and salts, but
with vitamine removed or destroyed; and although receiving
calories enough, they fail to keep up their nutrition.
With a simple change of dietary to include a small
amount of food containing the vitamine, without any
change in the total calories eaten, their nutrition improves
quickly, and they come back to a normal state.</p>

<p>Foods rich in vitamine are represented by milk, fresh
vegetables, fresh fruits, and whole grain products. Foods
poor in these substances are represented by sterilized
and preserved milks, dried fruits, dried vegetables, white
flour, and polished rice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">Pg 32</a></span></p>

<p>Vitamines are reduced or lost by the following processes
in the preparation of foods: taking off the coating
of grain, overheating, washing out in cooking, and drying.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Importance of Water</i></p>

<p>Water, although not a food in the sense of yielding
fuel value to the body, is a most important agent in
all the various chemical processes taking place in the
tissues.</p>

<p>Water is the universal solvent; and because of this
property, it carries both food and waste to and from
the tissues. The average person needs from three to
five quarts a day, a part of which is taken as a portion
of the food eaten. This leaves from three to five pints
to be taken as a drink. Good drinking water should be
colorless, odorless, and of an agreeable taste; should be
free from organic matter, poisonous metals, and the bacteria
of disease; and should be low in nonpoisonous mineral
salts&mdash;that is, should be reasonably soft.</p>

<p>There are three common classes of water that are
used for drinking purposes; namely, rain water, surface
water, and ground water. Rain water is the purest if
properly collected. Surface water&mdash;water from lakes,
streams, etc.&mdash;is most likely to be contaminated with
organic matter and bacteria. Ground water&mdash;that is,
water from springs and wells&mdash;is likely to be the hardest,
but is usually free from bacteria of disease unless
there is some contamination from the surface. To take a
fairly good quantity of water between meals is better
than to drink too freely at the meal hour.</p>

<p>Great care should be taken in selecting the supply of
drinking water, as when contaminated, it is a very fruitful
means for the transmission of diseases, particularly
such diseases as typhoid fever. If not certain of the
purity of a water supply, one can be sure to destroy all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">Pg 33</a></span>
the disease-producing bacteria by boiling the water for
a few minutes, then cooling, and drinking as usual.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Simple Dietetic Principles</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. Food should be pleasant to the sight and the taste.</p>

<p>2. Eat slowly. Masticate thoroughly.</p>

<p>3. Do not wash down your food with water or any kind
of beverage.</p>

<p>4. Cheerfulness is an important aid to digestion. The
mind should be free from care, and the surroundings
pleasant.</p>

<p>5. Avoid overeating.</p>

<p>6. There should be between five and six hours' interval
between meals, and no food should be taken during this
interval.</p>

<p>7. Make your list of foods balance up with about ten
per cent protein, twenty-five to thirty per cent fat, and
sixty to sixty-five per cent carbohydrate.</p>

<p>8. Eat few kinds of food at a meal, but vary the menu
from day to day.</p>

<p>9. Food should be properly cooked to get the best results.</p>

<p>10. Do not eat late at night. The evening meal should
be the lightest.</p>

<p>11. Eat green vegetables frequently in season.</p>

<p>12. Fresh fruits are very helpful in the diet.</p>

<p>13. Combine fruits, grains, and nuts.</p>

<p>14. Fruits and coarse vegetables are not a good combination.</p>

<p>15. It is better not to take large quantities of cane sugar
and milk together.</p>

<p>16. Do not eat rich and complicated mixtures of food.</p>

<p>17. Flesh meats are expensive, they make the protein
high, and are second-hand foods. Their place may easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">Pg 34</a></span>
be supplied by other foods.</p>

<p>18. Avoid excessive amounts of salt.</p>

<p>19. Do not use pepper or other irritating condiments
and spices in seasoning your food.</p>

<p>20. Tea and coffee are not foods, and should be entirely
dispensed with.</p>

<p>21. Alcohol is a poison, and should be entirely eliminated
from the menu.</p>

<i>D. D. COMSTOCK, M.D.</i><br />
for years Medical Superintendent of Glendale<br />
Sanitarium, Glendale, California</p>

<p>The body is a machine, intricate, complicated, "fearfully
and wonderfully" constructed. In one way, it is
simple in its operations; but in another, so ultrascientific
in the detail of its automatic control, and so deep in the
mysteries of its chemical processes, that the investigation
of ages has not been able to fathom its greater scientific
depths, and bring to the surface a knowledge of its ultimate
structure and its wonderful workings. The Master
Designer of the living machine so adjusted its mechanism
that in its original environment and relationship, its care
would be easy, and the laws of its preservation few and
exceedingly simple.</p>

<p>Like most machines, the human machine requires the
impartation of energy. Similarly, also, this is supplied by
the combustion of certain carbonaceous substances. It
needs constant repair. These and its other needs are all
furnished in the daily food supply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">Pg 36</a></span></p>

<p>The life of this machine can be greatly lengthened by
intelligent care, or shortened by neglect and abuse. Its
efficiency may be similarly affected. While one cannot
hear the pounding of the engine or the rattling of the
machinery, yet the machine is damaged if run under too
high a pressure and at too great speed.</p>

<p>There are seven classes of the essential elemental food
substances,&mdash;proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamines,
salts, cellulose, and water. The ideal diet is one in which
these seven elements are regularly supplied to the body in
the amounts required to meet its daily needs. A person
living close to nature, receiving his food first-handed, direct
from nature's health food factory, and eating it with
only the cooking and seasoning necessary, and with a
reasonable variety, would probably find his diet sufficient,
and the elements in about the proper proportions; and
with an honest appetite, steadied by a little temperate-in-all-things
ballast, he probably would not go far astray as
to the proper amounts. But unfortunately, the average
individual is not living close to nature. Much that is
artificial has come in. Our appetites are capricious, deceitful,
and unreasonable. Our foods come to us processed,
cartonned, and tinned, often embalmed, devitalized,
or adulterated. They are often served to us so
disguised that we cannot tell whether their nutritive substance
has been concentrated or diluted, or indeed whether
or not the body will recognize it as having any nutritive
value at all, despite its pleasing flavor. Therefore, in
order that the ideal may be approximated to a reasonable
and practical degree, we must have some knowledge not
only of the needs of the body, but also of these food
elements, and how their values may be estimated in the
various food substances.</p>

<p>The foods that enter into the make-up of the body and
supply its heat and energy are three,&mdash;protein, fat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">Pg 37</a></span>
carbohydrate. While the salts to a certain extent enter
into the body structure, they have but little to do with
heat and energy production. The remaining food classes
are adjuncts, their use being simply to make possible the
utilization, by the body, of the tissue and fuel foods. The
cellulose assists mechanically in digestion; the water furnishes
the necessary fluid; and the vitamines provide the
battery, as it were, which sets the whole apparatus in
motion.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>The Heat Unit</i></p>

<p>Of the many persons who, for economical or hygienic
reasons, have tried to adjust their diet better, some have
undertaken the task without a fundamental knowledge
of the physiological and caloric value of foods, their composition,
or the nutritional needs of the body, and have
done themselves more harm than good. It is possible for
us to measure the value of our foods, and to express it in
terms of heat units; and with a knowledge of the bodily
needs, we may supply ourselves with foods in approximately
the amounts needed, and in the best combinations.
Food oxidized in the body produces the same amount of
heat as that burned outside the body, and the instrument
by which the heat value of any substance is determined is
called a calorimeter. The unit of measure of heat is called
the calorie or heat unit.</p>

<p>The calorimeter consists of a double chamber, the
outer one containing a given quantity of water. The inner
chamber is thus surrounded by a water jacket. In it is
placed a definite amount of pure, water-free food to be
tested; for example, an ounce of sugar. By means of an
electric connection, the sugar is ignited and burned, and
the heat produced thereby is imparted to the water in the
outer chamber. When the process is complete, the difference
in the temperature of the water is noted, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">Pg 38</a></span>
amount of heat generated is computed. The calorie is
the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of
one pound of water four degrees F., or one kilogram one
degree C. In this way, the heat values of pure protein,
fat, starch, and sugar have been determined. In the
laboratories of the United States government, the composition
and caloric value of practically every food substance
known has been worked out. Any person can have access
to these tables of food values by applying to the government,
or by purchasing from almost any bookstore any
one of the several books on food values, that are on the
market. (See pages 23-27 of this book.)</p>

<p>The heat value of a gram of pure, water-free protein&mdash;for
example, the casein of milk, egg albumen, or fiber
of meat&mdash;is a trifle more than four calories. That of
pure starch or sugar is also four calories. Fat is more
than double this value, one gram yielding nine and three
tenths calories. Since an ounce equals about thirty grams,
the number of calories to an ounce is determined by multiplying
the above figures by thirty. Different kinds of
food vary greatly in the proportion of the food elements
and also of the water and cellulose they contain. (Cellulose
has no fuel value in the human body.) We therefore
find a great variation as to their caloric values also.
For example, one heaping tablespoonful of home-baked
beans will weigh about fifty grams, thirty of which is
water and cellulose. Its total caloric value is one hundred,
divided among protein fifteen, fat forty (the fat has
largely been added), and carbohydrate forty-five. Contrast
with this the same quantity of mashed turnips. One
heaping tablespoonful will weigh about seventy grams,
of which sixty-five is water and cellulose. Its total fuel
value is three calories.</p>

<p>By a little study, one may very readily become familiar
with the approximate values of the more common foods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">Pg 39</a></span>
and be able to arrive at some conclusion in regard to the
correctness of one's daily food ration as to amount and
proportions. Many would be surprised to see how far
short their diet comes of the ideal.</p>

<p>It is easy to remember that an ordinary slice of bread&mdash;about
three and one half inches square&mdash;contains approximately
one hundred calories; an average egg, sixty-five;
a glass of milk, one hundred fifty; an average potato,
one hundred twenty-five; a tablespoonful of gravity cream,
fifty; the usual serving of cooked cereal, seventy-five to
one hundred; vegetables, except potatoes, an ordinary
serving, twenty-five to fifty, depending on the amount of
fat or milk added as seasoning; legumes, average serving,
one hundred to one hundred fifty. Desserts are usually
high in value, ranging from one hundred twenty-five
calories in the usual serving of simple custard or junket
to three hundred fifty or more in the usual one sixth of
some pies, or the ordinary piece of cake.</p>

<p>Housewives who wish to go into the question of foods
thoroughly, and combine the science with the art of cookery,
may arrange a table of the staples and raw food that
ordinarily enter into their various recipes, somewhat
after the following, the items of which have been taken
at random from such a list or table already prepared
and in use:</p>

<p>If the cake is cut into twelve servings, the value of
each may be determined by dividing each of these sums
by twelve. Thus each piece will represent in value, protein,
twenty-one calories; fat, ninety calories; carbohydrate,
one hundred seventy-five calories; total, two hundred
eighty-six calories.</p>

<p>The number of calories needed by the individual varies
with height, age, sex, climate, and state of muscular activity;
but for the average person, two thousand calories
daily may be taken as a working basis. If one is engaged
in active muscular labor, the requirement may be three
thousand or more. Many persons of sedentary habits do
better on less than two thousand. Other things being
equal, men need about ten per cent more than women.
Children need about ten per cent more than adults. An
obese individual, or one suffering from the results of imperfect
oxidation, as manifested in rheumatism, neuralgia,
and myalgia, may do well for a time on as low an allowance
as one thousand one hundred to one thousand two
hundred food units daily, experiencing marked relief from
symptoms, and if obese, a reduction in weight of from
one to four pounds a week.</p>

<p>It should be kept in mind that the amount of protein
needed is quite constant, and does not vary with one's
state of activity, as does the demand for the fats and the
carbohydrates. From two hundred to two hundred fifty
calories of this element are needed daily, even though the
total ration be low. If one does well on the low ration
suggested above, the protein should not be lowered proportionately,
as would be the tendency. This is the repair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">Pg 41</a></span>
substance, which the body, not being able to store up,
must have supplied to it in regular daily amounts.</p>

<p>Excess in eating is often due to the use of certain
concentrated foods. A teaspoonful of olive oil contains
forty calories; the ordinary pat of butter (one fourth
ounce), fifty calories; a heaping teaspoonful of sugar,
forty calories; one English walnut, thirty-three calories;
a fair sized olive, twenty calories. While these are good
foods, they should be eaten with due regard for their
high energy value, that the proper food balance be not
disturbed. After eating a good square meal, the average
individual calls for the dessert, which, with its accompaniments,
actually constitutes a second meal; as, for
example, a serving of pie, three hundred fifty calories;
its cheese accompaniment, another one hundred calories;
a few stuffed dates, another one hundred calories; a few
nuts and raisins and a cup of chocolate bringing the total
value of this second meal forced upon the body up to
seven hundred or eight hundred calories.</p>

<p>Vegetables of themselves are low in caloric value, their
importance being due to the cellulose, salts, and vitamines
they contain. But they are usually prepared with so much
butter or cream that as served they have a high caloric
value in fat. Lean meat is practically pure protein, and
the tendency of the meat eater is to get an excess of this
element. The vegetarian often goes to the other extreme,
his diet showing a deficiency in protein, with an excess of
fats and carbohydrates. That the protein balance be kept
normal is an important matter, for a person may at one
and the same time be suffering from the results of a deficient
diet and also from the effects of overeating. The
protein needed daily is from ten to thirteen per cent of
the total ration. If the total daily ration is but one thousand
five hundred calories, the protein should still be two
hundred calories, and therefore thirteen per cent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">Pg 42</a></span>
total. Thus if a person is living on foods containing less
than ten per cent, there is danger of not getting enough
of this important element. Much of the food eaten is less
than ten per cent protein, because of the addition to it of
fat and sugar in large amounts.</p>

<p>So-called meat substitutes should be high in the percentage
of protein, in order to make up for the butter,
sugar, oils, olives, desserts, fruits, and other very low protein
foods that enter so largely into one's dietary. The
question has been asked, Why object to the addition of fat
to a meat substance, since it does not actually reduce the
quantity of protein, though it does relatively? In reply,
it may be said that the relative reduction makes necessary
an excess of the nonnitrogenous foods, to get enough
protein; and even though one's capacity should receive it
comfortably, still the objection to the excess aliment remains.</p>

<p>A study of food composition and values will enable the
housewife so to plan her meals that the various elements
may be served to her family in the proper proportions.
A knowledge of calories, and an intelligent application of
the principles involved in these questions of nutrition, will
enable any housewife to reduce the cost of feeding her
family from twenty-five to fifty per cent, which would
be worth while from an economical standpoint, not to
mention the advantage to be realized healthwise.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Vitamines</i></p>

<p>Says Lusk, "It has thus far been shown that nutrition
means fuel for the machinery, new parts with which to
repair the machine, and minute quantities of vitamines,
which produce a harmonious interaction between the materials
in the food and their host."</p>

<p>In the words of another investigator, "The study of
dietetics from the standpoint of the vitamines has only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">Pg 43</a></span>
just begun." Sufficient has been learned and demonstrated
about them, however, to show that they play a
most important part in nutrition and in vital tissue processes.
Since they are so little understood, a complete
definition is not yet possible. The pure vitamine, it seems,
cannot be isolated, so their exact chemical nature is not
known. The chemical process necessary to free it is no
sooner begun than the vitamine is apparently decomposed,
and all trace of it is lost. One is reminded of the efforts
of some early investigators to submit living protoplasm
to a chemical analysis, they hoping thereby to reveal the
mysteries of physical life itself; but at the first intrusion,
this subtle something flees, taking its secrets with it, and
leaving us only the empty shell of dead protein matter.
While the activities and manifestations of life are seen on
every hand in animal and plant, we are but little the
wiser as to what life really is.</p>

<p>Vitamines seem to stand closely related to the living
process in the tissue cells. Some investigators have
thought them to be the mother substances of the various
bodily ferments and internal secretions, any disturbance
of which produces serious constitutional troubles. Therefore
the continuous use of a diet lacking in any of these
mother substances would of necessity lead to a deficiency
of these absolutely essential vital secretions and ferments.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Vitamines and Disease</i></p>

<p>Years were spent in investigation before it was found
out that beriberi, a disease of the Orient, could be cured
and prevented by the addition, to the diet, of certain nutritive
elements in the covering of the rice, that are
ordinarily removed in the polishing process, and thrown
away. Just what these nutritive elements were, was not
understood; but the fact remained that a diet of polished
rice resulted in symptoms of beriberi, while a diet of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">Pg 44</a></span>
unpolished grain was sufficient to prevent any manifestations
of the disease. In Java, where the people lived
largely on whole rice, beriberi was unknown. For years,
the fact had been recognized, that sailors living on canned
and preserved foods sooner or later developed scurvy,
which could be quickly cured by an addition of fresh vegetables
or the juice of fruits, especially lemons and oranges,
to the diet. In 1535, when all but three of Cartier's one
hundred ten sailors had scurvy, he cured them all by giving
them a decoction of fresh pine needles. Babies fed on
Pasteurized milk often develop infantile scurvy.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Convincing Experiments</i></p>

<p>Vitamines are made only in nature's laboratory. The
body cannot make them, therefore mother's milk is deficient
in vitamine if her diet is. This is demonstrated
in a decided way in the Philippine Islands, where the
diet is deficient in the vitamine preventing beriberi.
Among the Filipinos, one half the deaths take place before
the end of the first year of age; and in these infants,
one half the deaths are due to beriberi. Pellagra, a disease
of obscure &#230;tiology, or cause, manifests itself principally
among a class of people who live on a monotonous
diet of corn bread, bacon, soda biscuit, and sirup. Some
authorities are quite convinced that it is a "deficiency"
disease. Also rickets, eczema, pyorrhea, and a number of
other diseases of obscure cause are beginning to be regarded
as being, in part at least, deficiency diseases. A
predisposition to tuberculosis and other infections may be
of similar cause. There are probably a number, possibly
many, of these vitamine substances. At least two have
been quite fully demonstrated,&mdash;the one preventing
scurvy, and the one preventing beriberi.</p>

<p>The experiments of Cosimir Funk, a Russian, are
convincing. He was able to produce experimental beriberi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">Pg 45</a></span>
in pigeons by feeding them for three weeks on
polished rice, then readily to cure them of the disease by
feeding the polishings from the same rice, showing that
in the rice polishings are certain elements absolutely essential
to life. He finally isolated what appeared to be
this substance, one pound of the polishings yielding about
three grains of the material. Injecting under the skin of
pigeons dying of beriberi one third of a grain of this
crystalline substance, he was able not only to make them
perfectly well in a few hours, but to keep them in health
for three weeks with but the one dose, even though they
were continued on a diet of polished rice. Funk named
this wonderful life-giving substance vitamine, because its
effects were life-giving, and chemically it seemed to belong
to the amines.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Where Found</i></p>

<p>Vitamines are found in plants, and especially in their
seeds. Fresh meat and raw milk contain them, although
animals seem incapable of making them. In summer,
milk is richer in them than in winter, because of the
difference in feed for the cattle. They are contained also
in yolks of eggs, whole grains, potatoes, carrots, beans,
peas, lentils&mdash;in fact, practically all green garden vegetables,
and fruit. In the grains, they are found in the
dark layer near the outer surface or branny layer, and
in the germ. In potatoes and other vegetables, they lie
immediately under the skin. Yeast bread contains more
than baking powder breads.</p>

<p>Vitamines are lost by the processing of grains; that
is, by the removal of the outer layers, which contain most
of these substances. Hence the whole grain should be
included in the flour. They are also destroyed by the
subjection of foods to too high a temperature. It is therefore
best to cook cereals at a low temperature, as in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">Pg 46</a></span>
fireless cooker. The vitamines are sacrificed in the drying
of foods, and in the paring of vegetables. If potatoes are
boiled, there is great advantage in boiling them in their
"jackets," in which case the vitamines and the salts are
not lost. If they are pared before they are boiled, the
potato water should not be thrown away, as it is rich in
vitamines, salts, and protein. Parboiling of other vegetables
is objectionable for the same reason. Soda and
baking powder and similar chemicals seem to destroy the
vitamines. This is one reason why yeast breads are better
than baking powder breads. Furthermore, in yeast fermentation,
the vitamine preventing beriberi is actually
formed, but not the vitamine preventing scurvy. The
natural foods that require cooking to make them edible
and wholesome contain vitamines which are not destroyed
thereby if the cooking is done in the most wholesome and
hygienic way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="fruits"></a>FRUITS AND THEIR<br />DIETETIC VALUE</h2>

</div>

<p class="center bold large"><i>by<br />
GEORGE A. THOMASON, M.D., L.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.</i></p>


<p>No other class of foods more delightfully or deliciously
contribute to the needs of the body than fruit. Fresh
from the lap of Nature, lavishly supplied, and delightful
to the eye, fruit makes most satisfying appeal to the
appetite of every one, from the quite indifferent to the
most discriminating epicure. Most easy of digestion, in
fact, practically predigested, fruit is most appropriate
for all people both in sickness and in health, and at all
periods of life, from babyhood to extreme age.</p>

<p>Fruit is made up of water, sugar, acids, some proteid,
and organic salts. Water is by far the largest constituent
of fruit, being seventy-five to eighty-five per cent. The
water of fruit is of the greatest possible purity, being
doubly distilled, first as rain, then as sap, drawn and
filtered through the tree.</p>

<p>The sugar of fruit is one of the most easily digested
forms, that of levulose. The starch of the unripe fruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">Pg 48</a></span>
is converted into sugar in the ripening process, or in the
cooking of partially ripened fruit. Sugar is present in
varying amounts in fruits, averaging from five to ten
per cent. A well ripened banana contains twenty-one
per cent of sugar, dates about fifty per cent, while grapes
contain from fourteen to twenty per cent.</p>

<p>The outward appearance of the fruit is often a fairly
reliable indication of the amount of sugar. Trielle has
observed that fruits with yellow skins contain much
sugar, and have a very penetrating odor. Fruits with
red skins contain a medium amount of sugar, and have a
pleasant, delicate perfume. Fruits with a reddish brown
skin usually contain much sugar, and have very little
perfume.</p>

<p>As showing its perfectly digested state, demonstrations
have proved that fruit sugar may be injected directly
into the blood, from which it will be utilized in
nourishing the body. This is in marked contrast with
ordinary cane sugar, which, if injected directly into the
blood, is expelled through the kidneys, the body being
unable to appropriate it as such from the blood.</p>

<p>Fruit sugar may be eaten in practically unlimited
quantities. It supplies the body with heat and energy
in the most available form. For this reason, fruit when
eaten will quickly relieve the sense of exhaustion.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Fruit Acids</i></p>

<p>The acids of fruits give to them their delightful and
appetizing flavors. Fruits in the unripe state contain
tannic acid, a marked astringent. The gastric and peristaltic
woes of the small boy the night following the
green apple episode are due to the tannic acid the unripe
fruit contains. The three chief acids of fruit are citric
acid, found in oranges, lemons, and grapefruit; malic acid,
as found in apples, pears, peaches, and similar fruits; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">Pg 49</a></span>
tartaric acid, as found in grapes. These are organic acids,
recognized and readily digested by the body.</p>

<p>The acids of fruits are remarkable peptogens; that
is, they stimulate the appetite and promote the flow of
the digestive juices. Fruit acids are most efficient disinfectants.
Some years ago, an eminent medical authority
of this country, in a representative medical gathering,
said, "We are as yet without a satisfactory medicinal
intestinal disinfectant." In fruit acids, we possess such
an agent in a most desirable form. No germ, disease-producing
or otherwise, can live in the presence of fruit
acid. Fruit acids can be taken practically <i>ad libitum</i>.
Fruit acids taken freely by mouth or diluted and injected
into the bowel, most efficiently asepticize the intestinal
canal. Three or four pints of water to which the juice
of one lemon has been added, injected into the bowel following
a cleansing enema, will thoroughly destroy disease-producing
bacteria in the colon. Flushing the bowel
frequently with such a solution is one of the most efficient
known means of successfully combating the fetid summer
diarrheas of children.</p>

<p>The proteid or nitrogenous element of fruits, as well
as their fatty element, may be passed over with little
consideration. Fruit contains little proteid; and aside
from the olive, there is almost no fat in fruit. The fat
of the ripe olive, however, is one of the most delicious
and digestible forms of fat. Ripe olives contain about
fifty per cent fat. Olive oil can be mixed with water;
therefore it readily mixes with the intestinal juices, and
is most easily digested.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Fruit Salts</i></p>

<p>The salts of fruit are most desirable, being so essential
in tissue building. Some of the most important of
these salts are potash, lime, phosphoric acid, and iron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">Pg 50</a></span>
Deficiency of the lime salts in the bones of children produces
conditions of bone softening, or rickets. This can
be largely prevented by adding fruit to the diet of these
afflicted children, using especially grapes, oranges, lemons,
and grapefruit, which contain high percentages of lime
salts.</p>

<p>The condition of an&#230;mia is a lack of iron in the blood.
This cannot be replaced by medicinal or metallic iron, as
the body is unable to appropriate these inorganic substances;
but the iron in fruit is perfectly adapted to the
body needs. Plums, cherries, and especially strawberries
and currants contain considerable iron, and are most
helpful in the treatment of an&#230;mic conditions.</p>

<p>It is perfectly apparent that fruits possess qualities
and constituents that make them of the greatest value
as an essential part of the daily ration to nourish and
energize the body, and to promote vital activities in the
maintenance of strength and healthful vigor. Fruit is
also an exceedingly important and efficient factor in restoring
to normal function tissues and organs that have
become vitiated and are functionating abnormally.</p>

<p>In spite of the widespread opinion to the contrary,
it can be positively asserted that fruit is of great service
in the prevention as well as in the treatment of rheumatism
and gout. The prejudice against the use of fruit
in rheumatism originated with the idea that the acids
of fruit tend to acidify the body. Quite the reverse is
true. The acids of fruit, when taken into the body, are
promptly converted into the alkali carbonates, thus increasing
the alkalinity of the blood, tending greatly to
benefit and cure the rheumatic condition, as well as to
lessen the general tendency to the formation of various
calculi, or stones, in the kidneys, the urinary bladder, and
the gall bladder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">Pg 51</a></span></p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Fruit and Obesity</i></p>

<p>A fruit diet is of great value in obesity. An exclusive
fruit diet may be taken to the greatest possible advantage
by the too corpulent who wish to reduce in weight. For
this purpose, fruit has the advantage of satisfying the
appetite while at the same time contributing very little
nutrition to the body. The free use of fruit is the method
par excellence for overcoming constipation. The eating
of a half dozen raw prunes before breakfast, or the taking
of the juice of one or two oranges, will in the majority
of cases be all that is necessary to maintain regular bowel
activity.</p>

<p>For an overworked liver, the so-called "bilious" state,
fruit is the best of all means of relief. Auto-intoxication
due to an excess of poisons circulating in the blood, is
treated most naturally and efficiently by a fruit diet.</p>

<p>The natural diuretic properties of fruit are very well
known. Nearly all fruits stimulate the kidneys to greater
activity, but watermelon is of particular service in this
respect.</p>

<p>Fruit and fruit juices greatly aid in successfully combating
alcoholism. The acid of the fruit juices help materially
in quenching the abnormal thirst.</p>

<p>There are but few individuals who would not be benefited
by an occasional exclusive fruit meal; and in many
cases, this can be maintained with greatest benefit for
even several days. This is a very popular method of
treatment in Europe, particularly in Switzerland, where
the "grape cure" is utilized. Patients are placed upon
a diet of grapes alone for several weeks, consuming from
seven to ten pounds of grapes a day. Wonderful results
are recorded at these resorts in the treatment of rheumatism,
gout, obesity, constipation, intestinal catarrh,
liver and kidney disorders, high blood pressure, arterial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">Pg 52</a></span>
sclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, and many more
physical disabilities.</p>

<p>Certain fruits, especially tart apples, are of great value
in the treatment of diabetes, lessening the tox&#230;mia of
this condition, as well as mitigating the abnormal thirst
that is so frequent and often distressing an accompaniment
of this condition.</p>

<p>In the eating of fruit, some care must be exercised
not to swallow large seeds or fruit pits. While the danger
of appendicitis from fruit seeds' becoming lodged in the
appendix has been greatly exaggerated, yet fruit seeds
have occasionally been found in the appendix, and proved
the exciting cause of the inflammation which followed.
Cases are on record of children who have swallowed considerable
quantities of grape seeds, suffering for months
of colic, and being only relieved by discharging quantities
of these seeds during energetic purgation.</p>

<p>It has been said that fruit is "gold in the morning,
silver at noon, and lead at night." But fruit is golden all
the time. This wonderful gift, one of the greatest and
best physical gifts of an all-wise Providence, cannot be
prized to highly; for it is considered sufficiently valuable
to endure for both time and eternity. Of the first man
and woman, it was said that they might eat of the fruit
of the trees of the garden; and it is said of the inhabitants
of the renewed earth, during eternity, that "they
shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them."</p>

<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>1. The Strength Delusion</i></p>

<p>Every movement we make, every thought we think,
and every heart throb, involves waste and the expenditure
of energy. There is a constant breaking down of our
tissues; and the food ingested is the source of the material
for repair. By its oxidation, digestion, and assimilation,
energy is liberated for life's varied activities.</p>

<p>The primary object of taking food is, in the words of
the wise man, "for strength, and not for drunkenness."
Any one who makes the pleasure of eating the chief
requisite will some day find, by a disordered stomach and
a clogged liver, that eating has ceased to be a pleasure.</p>

<p>The idea has long been current that superior qualities
of body and mind come from eating flesh food; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">Pg 54</a></span>
the verdict of science, after long observation and careful
investigation and various experiments, is rapidly reversing
this opinion.</p>

<p>The experiments of Prof. Russell H. Chittenden,
president of the American Physiological Society, and director
of the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale, are convincing.
His elaborate investigations, extending over long
periods of time, prove that persons of widely varying
habits of life, temperament, occupation, and constitution,
can maintain and even heighten their mental and physical
vigor while subsisting upon a diet containing but one half
the usual amount of protein, and in which the flesh is
reduced to a minimum or is entirely absent.</p>

<p>The subjects of the first experiment were three physicians,
three professors, and a clerk,&mdash;men of sedentary
and chiefly of mental occupation. For a period of six
months, they were required to reduce the amount of meat
and other protein food about one half. "Their weight
remained stationary; but they improved in general health,
and experienced a quite remarkable increase of mental
clearness and energy."</p>

<p class="center"><i>Chittenden's Researches</i></p>

<p>For his next experiment, Professor Chittenden used
a detachment of twenty soldiers from the hospital corps
of the United States army, "representing a great variety
of types of different ages, nationality, temperament, and
degrees of intelligence." For a period of six months,
these men lived upon a ration in which the proteid was
reduced to one third the usual amount, and the flesh to
five sixths of an ounce daily. There was a slight gain in
weight, "the general health was well maintained, and
with suggestions of improvement that are frequently so
marked as to challenge attention." "Most conspicuous,
however," remarks Professor Chittenden, "was the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">Pg 55</a></span>
observed on the muscular strength of the various subjects....
Without exception, we note a phenomenal gain in
strength which demands explanation." There was an
average gain in strength for each subject of about fifty
per cent.</p>

<p>For the third experiment, Professor Chittenden secured
as subjects a group of eight leading athletes of
Yale, all in training trim. For five months, they subsisted
upon a diet comprising from one half to one third
the quantity of protein food they had been in the habit
of eating. "Gymnasium tests showed in every man a
truly remarkable gain in strength and endurance."</p>

<p class="center"><i>Fisher's Experiments</i></p>

<p>Dr. Irving Fisher, professor of political economy of
Yale University, concluded a series of experiments testing
the endurance of forty-nine persons, about thirty of
the number being flesh abstainers. The first endurance
test was that of "holding the arms horizontally." The
flesh eaters averaged ten minutes. The flesh abstainers
averaged forty-nine minutes. The longest time for a
flesh eater was twenty-two minutes. The maximum time
for a flesh abstainer was two hundred minutes. The
second endurance test was that of "deep knee bending."
The flesh eaters averaged three hundred eighty-three
times, the flesh abstainers eight hundred thirty-three
times. Professor Fisher explains the results on the basis
that "flesh foods contain in themselves fatigue poisons of
various kinds, which naturally aggravate the action of the
fatigue poisons produced in the body."</p>

<p>Dr. J. Ioteyko, head of the laboratory at the University
of Brussels, compared the endurance of seventeen vegetarians
with that of twenty-five carnivores, students of
the University of Brussels. "Comparing the two sets of
subjects on the basis of mechanical work, it is found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">Pg 56</a></span>
the vegetarians surpassed the carnivores on the average
by fifty-three per cent."</p>

<p>Professor Fisher remarks, "These investigations, with
those of Combe of Lausanne, Metchnikoff, and Tisier of
Paris, as well as Herter and others in the United States,
seem gradually to be demonstrating that the fancied
strength from meat is like the fancied strength from alcohol,
an illusion."</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tests in Germany</i></p>

<p>Professor Rubner, of Berlin, "one of the world's foremost
students of hygiene," read a paper before the recent
International Congress of Hygiene and Demography on
the "Nutrition of the People," in which he said: "It is
a fact that the diet of the well-to-do is not in itself physiologically
justified; it is not even healthful; for on account
of the false notions of the strengthening effect of meat,
too much meat is used by young and old, and this is
harmful."</p>

<p>In the long distance races in Germany, the flesh abstainers
have invariably been easy victors. Upon this
point, Professor Von Norden, in his monumental work on
"Metabolism and Practical Medicine," says: "In Germany
at least, in these competitive races, the vegetarian is ahead
of the meat eater. The non-vegetarian cannot compete
with the vegetarian in the matter of endurance in these
long distance walks. The vegetarian is ahead in the
matter of rapid pedestrian feats."</p>

<p>A few years ago, a well-known athlete, Dr. Deighton,
walked from the southernmost point of England to the
northernmost point of Scotland, a distance of almost a
thousand miles, in twenty-four days and four hours. His
chief subsistence en route was a much advertised meat
juice. Mr. George Allen, who for a number of years had
subsisted upon a strict non-flesh diet, undertook the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">Pg 57</a></span>
task, which he accomplished in a little less than seventeen
days, that is, in seven days less time.</p>

<p>As in the heat engine, energy for light, heat, or power
does not come from burning copper, lead, or iron filings,
but from carbonaceous materials, as coal, coke, fuel oils,
etc., so in the human body, energy for warmth and muscular
effort comes not from oxidizing the metal repair
foods, the proteins, but from those foods which are rich
in carbon, the starches and the sugars, called the carbohydrates.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>2. Flesh Food a Stimulant</i></p>

<p>Whence then come these "illusions," these "false notions
of the strengthening effect of meat"? They come
from the fact that foods of this class are stimulating. A
stimulant is a counterfeit for strength. It is a physical
deceiver. It makes a person believe he is strong because
he "feels" strong, when it is not true at all. That which
is interpreted as strength is only nervous excitement. A
stimulant never builds up; it only stirs up. While pretending
to contribute energy, it actually robs the body of
strength. The resort to stimulants to whip up the flagging
energies of the body is an effort to trick nature in playing
the game of life. It is like borrowing money. Some day
the principal must be returned with interest to a relentless
creditor.</p>

<p>Beef tea contains less than one per cent nourishment,
but one can get the same kind of exhilaration from a cup
of beef tea as from a cup of brandy. This is due to the
drug effect of the beef tea, which is a solution of the waste
products, the poisonous extractives, of the meat. Every
animal organism is constantly throwing off these extractives,
such as urea, uric acid, creatinine, etc. The kidneys
have no other function than the removal of poisons. If
an animal is deprived of the use of its kidneys, it will die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">Pg 58</a></span>
of self-poisoning in a few days. When an animal is
slaughtered and the blood ceases to circulate, this stream
of urinary products on its way to the kidneys for excretion
stops in the tissues, and is devoured by the consumer
with the flesh.</p>

<p>Friedenwald and Ruhrah, in their book "Diet in Health
and Disease," say: "The extractives are probably of no
value either as a source of energy or in the formation of
tissues. They act as stimulants and appetizers, and it has
been stated that the craving some individuals have for
meat is in reality a desire for the extractives."</p>

<p>Armand Gautier, the eminent French dietitian, says on
this point, "Like the opium smoker, the individual who
accustoms himself to meat, feels that he misses it when he
does not take the usual excess."</p>

<p>If the poisonous waste products be removed from meat,
it is insipid, and is no more stimulating than the same
amount of bread.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>3. Ptomaine Poisoning</i></p>

<p>The seeds of death and decay are in every animal organism;
and just as soon as the heart ceases to throb, and
the arteries cease to pulsate, and the spark of life leaves
the animal, decomposition begins. These putrefactive
changes often result in the formation of violent poisons,
called ptomaines. The word "ptomaine" comes from a
Greek word meaning <i>carcass</i>, or <i>cadaver</i>; and the poisons
are variously called putrefactive alkaloid, animal alkaloid,
etc. The presence of fatal amounts of these poisons in
flesh may not be betrayed by any change in appearance,
odor, or taste. The common practice of keeping meat until
it becomes tender, or "ripens," is simply waiting for decomposition
to advance until the meat fiber is softened
by the process of decay. Canned meats are especially
liable to contain the poisonous ptomaine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">Pg 59</a></span></p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>4. Unbalances the Diet</i></p>

<p>It is of primary importance that one should guard
against consuming excessive quantities of any kind of
food material, but there is a difference. Should we take
an excess of starches or sugars, provision has been made
for storing a certain amount in the form of fat, or as
glycogen in the liver and the muscles; but no provision
is found for storing an excess of protein. An excess of
this food element is of particular injury to the body.
The extensive experiments of Professors Chittenden,
Fisher, and other scientific workers, have shown that for
efficient nutrition, we require that only one tenth of the
daily intake of food should be of the structure-building,
tissue-repairing protein. In the laboratory of nature,
the food elements have been so combined by the plants,
that the protein element is very low; and thus a diet
selected from the natural products of the earth is not
only free from uric acid and other waste products, but is
already balanced. The addition of flesh food&mdash;which
does not contain any starch&mdash;to the menu, at once raises
the protein constituent too high.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>5. Bright's Disease and High Blood Pressure</i></p>

<p>The waste products in the blood arising from excess
of protein are a leading cause of Bright's disease, auto-intoxication,
arteriosclerosis, and high blood pressure.
These maladies are often associated in the same individual,
and frequently have a common origin. Sir William
Osler, in his "Principle and Practice of Medicine," writes:
"I am more and more impressed with the part played
by overeating in inducing arteriosclerosis." "There are
many cases in which there is no other factor." Dr.
Alexander Haig, of London, states that uric acid makes
the blood "collaemic" or viscous, and then the heart has
difficulty to pump it through the capillaries. Hence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">Pg 60</a></span>
blood pressure increases. Isaac Ott, in his textbook on
physiology, says on this point, "Burton-Opitz has shown
that hunger reduces viscosity, and meat diet raises it to
a great height, whilst carbohydrates and fat diet give
average values to it."</p>

<p>In the colon, flesh foods rapidly undergo decomposition,
giving rise to numerous poisons, which are absorbed
into the blood, and are toxic to the nervous system,
and cast an additional burden upon the liver and the
kidneys. These are a sort of dietetic clinkers, which
throw nature's delicate machinery out of adjustment, and
produce various symptoms of auto-intoxication. Bouchard
found that the fecal and urinary excrement of
carnivorous animals is twice as poisonous when injected
into rabbits as that from a herbivorous animal. The
former also emits a strong odor, and the fecal discharges
are offensively repulsive. Dr. Haig, before quoted, also
asserts that "Bright's disease is the result of our meat-eating
and tea-drinking habits; and as these habits are
common, so also is the disease."</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>6. Tuberculosis, Ulcer, Cancer, and Appendicitis</i></p>

<p>While it is true that tuberculosis is more frequently
contracted through the use of tuberculous milk than from
tuberculous meat, the latter source of infection cannot
be ignored. Numerous cases of tuberculosis have been
reported where the infection could be directly traced to
the flesh of tuberculous animals.</p>

<p>Dr. E. C. Shroeder, of the Bureau of Animal Industry
of the United States Department of Agriculture, says:
"That ten per cent of the dairy cattle in the United States
are affected with tuberculosis impresses me as a very
conservative estimate. In New York State, about thirty-three
per cent of all cattle tested were found to be tuberculous."
Dr. Julius Rosenberg, of New York City, writes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">Pg 61</a></span>
"Cattle tuberculosis is rapidly increasing. There is
scarcely a dairy herd without a number of infected animals.
It is an ever growing menace. The health department
of Boston estimates the percentage of tuberculous
animals producing the city's milk supply to be from
twenty to twenty-five per cent. Conservative estimate
places the number of cows dying yearly from tuberculosis
at one million, were they permitted to die a natural
death; but they are killed before drawing the last gasp,
and served as prime beef." In one year in the United
States, the entire carcasses of thirty-five thousand one
hundred three cattle were condemned because of generalized
tuberculosis. In the same year, a portion of the
carcass of ninety-nine thousand seven hundred thirty-nine
more were rejected because of local tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Professor Ravenal, of the University of Wisconsin,
says that of the thirty-five million hogs killed for food
annually in the United States, seven million are found to
be infected with tuberculosis. Some one has said that
meat would sell for a dollar a pound if all the diseased
meat were eliminated.</p>

<p>Ulcer of the stomach is one of our most common
diseases. Leading surgeons have shown that it is ten
times as frequent as was formerly supposed. It is clearly
of dietetic origin, and is usually associated with too high
consumption of protein, and especially of meat. Starches,
sugars, and fats are not digested in the stomach, and
require no acid. Proteins, on the other hand, are digested
within the stomach, and require for their digestion a high
percentage of hydrochloric acid. The excessive production
of acid within the stomach, stimulated by too much
protein, is probably the chief cause of the formation of
ulcers. In 1908, Dr. Fenton B. Turck, of Chicago, said
before the American Medical Association: "Ulcer of the
stomach is not found in those countries where the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">Pg 62</a></span>
eat rice. It is evidently a meat eater's disease.
The zone of ulcer is in the meat eater's zone."</p>

<p>Cancer is a disease of modern civilization. It is the
one major unsolved problem in the field of medical science
to-day. From the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>
of June 14, 1913, we quote: "That cancer has
increased in recent years is perhaps a commonplace, but
the extent of the increase is not generally realized. Under
existing conditions, one in seven women and one in eleven
men die of cancer." In the <i>Medical Record</i>, issue of May
15, 1915, Dr. W. G. Mayo is quoted as saying: "Cancer
of the stomach forms nearly one third of all cancers of
the human body.... Is it not possible that there is something
in the habits of civilized man, in the cooking or
other preparation of his food, which acts to produce the
precancerous condition?... Within the last one hundred
years, four times as much meat is taken as before that
time. If flesh foods are not fully broken up, decomposition
results, and active poisons are thrown into an organ
not intended for their reception, and which has not had
time to adapt itself to the new function."</p>

<p>Dr. L. Duncan Bulkley, senior physician to the New
York Skin and Cancer Hospital, says on this point, "Analyzing
the various data obtained, we find that cancer has
increased in proportion to the consumption of four articles,
meat, coffee, tea, and alcohol."</p>

<p>One is hardly up to date who does not present an
abdominal scar caused by an offending appendix. At the
fifteenth International Congress of Hygiene and Demography
held in Washington, D. C., Dr. Henning contributed
a paper dealing with "statistics upon the increase of appendicitis
and its causes." He said: "A meat diet is of
great influence in the development of appendicitis. This
diet leads to constipation. In most instances, too long
retention of intestinal contents in the c&#230;cum causes slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">Pg 63</a></span>
inflammation in that region, the results of which are to
weaken the appendix, and to render it nonresistant
against later infection." When Dr. Lorenz, the celebrated
Vienna surgeon, was in the United States, he
called attention to the relatively greater prevalence of
appendicitis in this country as compared with Europe,
and attributed it to the greater consumption of cold
storage meats here, which he said rendered Americans
unduly septic, and especially prone to infection of the
appendix. Nicholas Senn was told by the hospital surgeons
in Africa that they had never seen a case of appendicitis
in a vegetable-eating African.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>7. Trichin&#230; and Tapeworms</i></p>

<p>"A story is told of two of the most noted of Germans,&mdash;Bismarck,
the statesman, and Virchow, the scientist.
The latter had severely criticized the former in his
capacity as chancellor, and was challenged to fight a duel.
The man of science was found by Bismarck's seconds
in his laboratory, hard at work at experiments which had
for their object the discovery of a means of destroying
trichin&#230;, then making ravages among animals in Germany.
'Ah,' said the doctor, 'a challenge from Prince
Bismarck, eh? Well, well, as I am the challenged party,
I suppose I have the choice of weapons. Here they are.'
He held up two large sausages, which appeared to be
exactly alike. 'One of these sausages,' he said, 'is filled
with trichin&#230;. It is deadly. The other is perfectly wholesome.
Externally, they can't be told apart. Let his
excellency do me the honor to choose whichever of these
he wishes and eat it, and I will eat the other.' No duel
was fought, and no one accused Virchow of cowardice."</p>

<p>The trichina is a small, wormlike parasite found in
the flesh of "measly pork," which, when eaten, burrows
in the muscles of the human, producing an extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">Pg 64</a></span>
painful and often fatal affection. About two per cent
of hogs, it is estimated, harbor this parasite.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, the human being becomes the
host of a tapeworm only by eating underdone flesh containing
the larv&#230; of the parasite. (Thoroughly boiled or
fried tapeworm is a harmless diet.) The ox, the hog,
and the fish frequently harbor the larv&#230; of tapeworms.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>8. Poor Economy</i></p>

<p>In these days of increased destruction and decreased
production of human foods, it is of great importance to
know how to secure a maximum amount of nutrition from
a minimum expenditure of money. The world is facing
a food shortage that in some places has assumed the
proportion of the gaunt specter of famine. In view of
this fact, it is well to remember that flesh is the most
costly source of food. Sixty-two per cent of the best
beefsteak is water. Flesh foods contain but twenty-five
per cent nourishment, and seventy-five per cent waste
matter. The grains contain seventy-five per cent nourishment,
and but twenty-five per cent waste. Now it
does not require a knowledge of higher mathematics to
determine that since ten pounds of grain, when fed to
an animal, make but one pound of flesh, the latter becomes
a very costly source of our food supply.</p>


<p><i>9. The Testimony of Anatomy and Physiology</i></p>

<p>Even a kindergarten study of the structure of the
human body reveals the fact that man was not intended
to be a carnivorous, a herbivorous, or an omnivorous
animal, but rather a frugivorous creature. He does not
possess the rough, raspy tongue of the cat family, the
long, pointed canine teeth of the lion, the sharp claws of
the tiger, or the talons and hooked beak of the eagle.
In the carnivora, the alimentary canal is very short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">Pg 65</a></span>
being only three times the length of the body. In herbivora,
as the sheep, it is thirty times the length of the
body. In frugivora, such as apes, monkeys, and man, it
is twelve times the body length. Baron Cuvier, a famous
anatomist, writes, "The natural food of man, judging
from his structure, appears to consist principally of the
fruits, roots, and other succulent parts of vegetables."</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>10. Flesh and Morals</i></p>

<p>The menu provided for man in the beginning did not
include animal food. Not until one thousand six hundred
fifty-six years of human history had passed was man
permitted to eat flesh, and then only after every green
thing had been destroyed by the Deluge. What we eat
exercises a profound influence upon what we are, how
we think, and how we feel. Let us divide the animal
kingdom on the basis of diet and disposition. On the one
hand, we have the lion, the tiger, the wolf, the bear, the
leopard, the panther, etc.; all these are vicious, snarly,
crabbed, ferocious beasts. What comprises their diet?
We call them "beasts of prey." They feast upon the
bloody, quivering flesh of their victims. On the other
hand, we might mention the horse, the ox, the deer, the
sheep, the elephant. Think of their dispositions, calm,
quiet, pacific, easily domesticated. May it not be that
their diet of cereals and herbs contributes to their peaceful
temperament?</p>

<p>Dr. Curtis, the eminent physician to Mr. Garfield,
said, "What parent is there who has not viewed with
alarm how old Adam enters into the baby along with the
first spoonful of chopped beef!" Gautier said, on this
point: "The vegetarian r&#233;gime, modified by the addition
of milk, of fat of butter, of eggs, has great advantage.
It adds to the alkalinity of the blood, accelerates oxidation,
diminishes organic wastes and toxins. It exposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">Pg 66</a></span>
one much less likely than the ordinary r&#233;gime to skin
maladies, to arthritis, to congestions of internal organs.
This r&#233;gime tends to make us pacific beings, and not aggressive
and violent."</p>

<p>To these we may add the testimony of Holy Writ,
"Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of
flesh."</p>

<p class="in0 drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> emotion of joy finds physiologic manifestations
exactly opposite to those of sorrow

the muscles, and expansion of the blood vessels.
As a result of increased muscular activity,
the joyful person feels light and springy. Children,
when joyful, dance and skip and clap their hands. The
expansion of the blood vessels brings the "flush of joy."
This increase in the circulation causes increased secretion
of the digestive juices, with increased appetite, and increased
power of digestion and absorption. This means
increased nourishment. "Laugh and grow fat" has a physiologic

ARTHUR N. DONALDSON, A.B., M.D.</i><br />
of the Faculty of the College of Medical<br />
Evangelists, Loma Linda, California</p>

<p>The Creator intended that the process of eating
should be enjoyed. He has gathered the tasteless, insipid
food elements together, and mixing in mineral and
organic accessories, has produced for the tickling of our
palates all the numberless flavors that the combined action
of those highly specialized organs of taste and smell
have enabled us to enjoy. The tasteless starch is bound
up in the palatable potato; the insipid protein, in the pea,
the lentil, and the bean; the rather nauseating fat, in
the plump, appetizing olive. To the child not yet educated
to the perverted demands of his father's palate, the
thought, taste, and smell of these aromatic and savory
substances produces a desire to eat. By the time he is
twenty, he will not be satisfied with the natural flavor
of his food. The cook must pepper or ginger it up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">Pg 68</a></span>
he must further mustard or Worcestershire it to get it
down. His soups are hot, and his salads are hotter. The
palatable pleasure in a meal of his childhood is a lost
asset. What has brought about this change in the appetite
of man?</p>

<p>We all know, from experience, that we handle our
food better if we relish it. This is due largely to the
fact that the taste organs telegraph ahead to the stomach
to prepare for work. The stomach responds by pouring
out some digestive juices, and is consequently all ready
to begin business the instant the tourist arrives. But
when the food is bolted, there is a failure on the part of
the taste nerves to telegraph ahead, unless they are stimulated
more intensely by the addition of some readily diffusible
sapid substance. Are we thus fooling nature?&mdash;We
are not. Primarily, this unnatural stimulation leads
to the most prevalent American dietetic sin; namely,
overeating. We do not know when we have had enough.
Dr. Wiggers, of Cornell University, has shown that overeating
results in the surcharging of the blood stream with
elements of digestion; and this, through the operation of
physical laws, ultimately leads to arteriosclerosis and its
chain of disasters. Secondly, with this unnatural stimulation
of the taste nerves, the telegraphic messages to the
stomach and the intestine are unreliable. Normally the
tract is informed as to the nature of the food about to
come, and is thus enabled to pour out a specific juice for
a specific kind of food. Obviously this specificity which
characterizes all normal processes is broken down, and
the digestive function is placed under a handicap, when
we cover up the natural taste with condiments.</p>

<p>The idea that condiments and stimulants act favorably
in directly stimulating the production of gastric juice and
in increasing gastric motor activity, and thus facilitating
the digestive process, is a delusion. Professor Carlson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">Pg 69</a></span>
of Chicago University, has shown that these so-called
stomachics and appetizers will have done their bit ere
they enter the misunderstood stomach. And, our savory
sauces and peppers being irritants in the mouth, they are
no less irritants to the lining membrane of the stomach.
They are always taboo in mild dyspeptic disorders, yet
we think them just the appetizers for the run down nervous
individual who never enjoys the pangs of hunger.
Rather, he should be advised to oxygenate his impoverished
blood by a brisk walk, to stir up his eliminative organs
by vigorous exercise and the ingestion of water; for
these bring no gastric catarrh, no sluggish liver.</p>

<p>It is recognized by every writer on dietetics, that condiments
are irritating to the organs of elimination. The
kidneys suffer, the ureters suffer, the bladder suffers,
and the urethra suffers. We are very quick to stop the
use of these substances when the kidneys give evidence
of disease, and we will with alacrity drop the hot stuff
from our dietary when the bladder and the urethra are
inflamed. We do not like the smarting, burning pain
produced by their presence. If they are detrimental during
disease processes, they are just as detrimental in
health. The long continued use of minute quantities of
an irritant will incontrovertibly give ultimate evidence
of its harmful nature, and we may expect such pathology
as congestion of the liver, catarrh of the alimentary
tract, hemorrhoids, nephritis, and general nutritive disturbances
to be the possible heritage of our stimulating
diet.</p>

<p>It is an interesting scientific fact that the highly soluble
substances which are used as foods or food accessories
are always irritating to the living membranes, particularly
to the mucous membranes of the digestive organs
with which they come in contact in the process of
digestion, whether these membranes are healthy or diseased.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">Pg 70</a></span>
Among such substances, we may mention sugar
and salt.</p>

<p>Sugar and salt are excellent examples of the sapid,
readily diffusible condiment so essential to our table, yet
so invariably used to excess. We need about two teaspoonfuls
of common salt a day&mdash;especially those who
enjoy the vegetarian diet. Most vegetables are rich in
potassium. This inorganic substance combines with sodium
chloride, and is eliminated from the body. Consequently,
the greater the amount of potassium in our food,
the greater will be the loss of sodium chloride from the
blood and the tissues, where it is an essential element,
with the resultant need of an increased supply in our
diet. Where there is an insufficient use of salt, there is
a manifest disinclination to partake of the large variety
of earth's products rich in potassium. But we are accustomed
to the use of far more salt with our food than is
necessary; and in excess, it is positively harmful, and the
results of its use are serious.</p>

<p>Sugar is a pure carbohydrate; yet, by reason of its
nature and use, it must be classed as a condiment. It,
too, when used freely, brings on gastrointestinal catarrh
through its direct irritant action, and affords unexcelled
media for the growth of intestinal flora.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Stimulants</i></p>

<p>There are practically four strong stimulants to which
civilized people are addicted; namely, alcohol, tobacco,
tea, and coffee. Of the action of all, it may be said that
the fatigue of nerve and brain is soothed by a spur. That
is the work of a stimulant,&mdash;to goad the worn system to
added effort, to produce an abnormal, false energy. Thus
the individual is led on to a state of actual exhaustion
without a warning note from his fatigued system. His
energy is actually dissipated rather than increased. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">Pg 71</a></span>
results are shown in his heart, his nervous system, and
his eliminative organs. Admiral Peary, speaking of the
use of coffee in the rations of polar explorers, states that
with the added effect of intense cold, it so stimulates
the nerves as to cause the men to exhaust themselves,
and soon wear out, by doing more than they can endure.</p>

<p>The actual extent of injury from the moderate use
of tea and coffee has not been scientifically determined.
The difficulty is, as Irving Fisher states it, "Sensitive
people do not keep moderate." A little unnatural stimulation
calls for a little more, and the tendency is to create
a demand for something stronger. Fisher has truthfully
declared that to abstain is much easier than to be
moderate.</p>

<p>The claim that alcoholic beverages give added strength
is a fallacy. The narcotic action of alcohol benumbs the
sense of fatigue. From reliable clinical and laboratory
findings, we are warranted in asserting with authority
that alcohol lowers the power of all mental processes.
The muscular efficiency is reduced. The ability of the
body to protect itself against disease is undermined. The
policemen of the body&mdash;the white corpuscles&mdash;are rendered
more or less inactive&mdash;paralyzed; and the formation
of other resistive elements of the blood is restricted.
In other words, vital resistance is below par. Alcohol
is furthermore a heart and circulatory depressant, and
is no longer used by competent physicians as a circulatory
stimulant. In short, it lowers mental and physical efficiency,
and of course will naturally give its stamp to the
unfortunate offspring.</p>

<p>Tobacco, too, blunts the edge of fatigue and worry.
But its effect is transient, and the stimulation is followed
by depression, which of course calls for more of the stimulant.
Statistics tell us that where the weed is prohibited,
efficiency is increased, and morale is improved.</p>

<p>Among the serious consequences of smoking, we find
cancer of lip, tongue, and mouth, and serious cardiovascular
changes. In a series of one hundred cases of cancer
of the tongue and mouth, Dr. Abbe, of New York, found
that ninety were inveterate users of tobacco; and he gives
the stimulant the credit of being the &#230;tiological factor in
a high percentage of all malignant growths in this region.
Tobacco not only directly affects the heart muscle, but
its nicotine, through stimulation of the suprarenal gland,
causes the production and throwing into the blood of an
excessive amount of adrenalin, which brings about a tremendous
rise in blood pressure, and of course an increase
in the burden that the heart must carry. The ultimate result
is arteriosclerosis, tobacco heart, nephritis, and very
possibly a closing of the scene with a paralytic stroke.</p>

<p>Professor Fisher very aptly appeals against the introduction
of more poisons into a system already burdened
with poisons of its own elaboration.</p>

<p>We are not at liberty to ignore nature and her laws.
Our bodies are not our own. When the Creator has
opened to us of heaven's abundance for the sustenance of
life, and has given us a dietary that answers every need
of palate and body, we are palpably in error before our
Maker when we question His wisdom, and take into our
systems those substances which we know to be destructive
to mind, soul, and body.</p>

<p class="center bold large"><i>by<br />
Mr. H. S. ANDERSON</i><br />
Food Specialist, College of Medical Evangelists and<br />
Loma Linda Sanitarium</p>

<p>The art of planning and combining the food for a meal
is of no small importance to the housewife or the cook.
The very best foods may be served in such combinations
as to bring distress to the digestive organs, and produce
weakness instead of strength.</p>

<p>Because human beings differ so much, and their needs
are so varied, it is impossible to lay down any set of rules
on diet alike for all. There are general principles, however,
by which all may be guided, and which, if heeded,
can accomplish more for the individual or the family, in
maintaining health, than all doctors' prescriptions. This
is made plain by the fact that it is better to know how to
keep well than how to cure disease.</p>

<p>It is therefore of great importance for those who have
the responsibility of planning for the table, to have a
working knowledge of the principles which guide in making
out a balanced menu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">Pg 74</a></span></p>

<p>In the planning of a meal, careful study should be
given to the combination of foods. On the one hand, only
such foods as digest well together should be used at one
meal. On the other hand, foods should be chosen that
will supply all the needed elements in about the right proportion.</p>

<p>Because of the woody substances found in vegetables,
especially the coarse or fibrous vegetables, such as carrots,
beets, turnips, cabbage, potatoes, and others, they digest
slowly, and consequently remain a long time in the stomach
before they are broken sufficiently for intestinal digestion.
Fruits remain in the stomach a short time, and, owing to
the large amount of saccharine matter they contain, are
apt to ferment if retained too long.</p>

<p>Fruit and vegetables therefore should not be eaten at
the same meal. This has special reference to the coarse
and underground vegetables; while the finer or fruity
vegetables, such as green peas, corn, squash, tomatoes,
etc., and some others which also ripen in the sun, may be
used with almost any food.</p>

<p>A safe rule in planning a meal, is to be sure that the
<i>soup</i>, the <i>relishes</i> (greens, salads, etc.), and the <i>dessert</i>,
if used, combine well together, as these are so generally
used by nearly all classes of people when placed on the
menu. Then if fruit is used, in salad, or as dessert, there
should be on the menu at least one of the finer vegetables,
such as tomatoes, corn, or the like, which can be eaten
with the fruit; and if the meal is planned without fruit,
any of the coarser vegetables may be used as desired.</p>

<p>A large variety should not be planned for any one
meal. It is a great additional expense; and besides, when
several articles are taken at one meal, fermentation is
likely to occur and the system will not be so well nourished.
Recent research work has shown that the digestive
juices vary both in kind and in quantity with different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">Pg 75</a></span>
kinds of food eaten. This may explain why many
persons cannot digest complex mixtures and extensive
variety, and is a mighty argument for simplicity at meal-time.</p>

<p>A select variety, of only a few kinds of food, at any
one meal, with diversity in the meals from day to day,
will prove advantageous to the individual and the family,
both from the standpoint of economy, and from the health
point of view.</p>

<p>An excess of milk and sugar taken together clogs the
system, and should be avoided. Fats are more digestible
cold than hot, because hot fat tends to coat and intimately
penetrate the food with which it is cooked. This is especially
true of fried foods, part of the food being surrounded
with a layer of fat, keeping the digestive juices
from acting on the other food elements. When subjected
to a high temperature, fats decompose, and the resulting
acids are very irritating to the mucous membranes of
the stomach and the intestines.</p>

<p>The following combinations of food digest well together:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">Grains, fruits, and nuts</li>
<li class="isub2">Grains with milk</li>
<li class="isub2">Grains with eggs</li>
<li class="isub2">Grains, vegetables, and nuts</li>
</ul>

<p>Foods that do not digest well together are:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">Milk and sugar taken together, in large quantities</li>
<li class="isub2">Fruit and vegetables</li>
<li class="isub2">Foods cooked in fats</li>
</ul>

<p>A balanced dietary is one that supplies in about the
right proportion all the kinds of food required to nourish
the body. From the earliest impressions of childhood,
many persons have received the idea that the most important
article of diet is animal flesh. In most cases, this
idea has been accepted without question or thought, and
probably has never been challenged. A careful study of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">Pg 76</a></span>
the subject, however, will show that with the use of meat,
there is great danger of an excess of protein above the
minimum requirements, there being thus placed upon the
liver and the kidneys an amount of work which should
not be imposed on these vitally important organs.</p>

<p>To combine foods in such a way as to supply all the
needed elements, we should choose something from each
of the different classes of food elements. There should
also be among these such as supply sufficient cellulose and
mineral. To illustrate this point, a few menus will be
given that are extremely unbalanced, or one-sided, that
we may understand more forcibly, by contrast, what a
good meal is:</p>

<p>In order to make a balanced meal out of the above
foods, it would be necessary to choose something from
each of these unbalanced meals, and it would not be necessary
to choose a large variety in order to supply the needs
of the body. Upon examination, we find that bread (entire
wheat) possesses properties which so nearly represent
the constituent parts of the body as to make such
bread ideal for the building up and keeping in repair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">Pg 77</a></span>
the human body. In the matter of building food (protein),
bread contains about ten per cent, or about the
recognized dietary requirement.</p>

<p>Bread is an exceedingly digestible food; and experiments
taken as a whole show nearly ninety-eight per cent
of the starch, or carbohydrate nutrients, and about
eighty-eight per cent of the gluten, or protein constituents,
assimilated by the body. See Snyder's "Human
Foods," page 179; also table, page 23.</p>

<p>Many other grains, such as corn, oats, rye, barley, and
rice, all contain heat- and energy-producing substances
and tissue-forming elements in about the right proportion
to meet the needs of the body. Exception is made of
rice, which is slightly deficient in protein.</p>

<p>Bread of some kind, therefore, is the "backbone" of
the meal. Around it are grouped the various fruits and
vegetables for change and variety, alternating with one
of the more solid foods, rich in protein, such as cottage
cheese, eggs, nuts, or any of the various legumes, as peas,
beans, lentils, etc. Of all the legumes, the soy bean takes
the lead for building food, containing nearly twice the
per cent of protein found in round steak. These more
hearty foods should be used with discretion, especially
during the summer months, when well baked breads,
fruits, and green garden products constitute the ideal diet.</p>

<p>Potatoes, which are mostly starch, and eggs, which are
largely albumen and fat, may be combined in such a way
as to furnish all the needed elements in the right proportion.
As rice is nearly all starch, and beans are rich in
protein, these make an excellent combination. Nuts, rich
in proteins and fats, and fruits, containing sugars and
acids, also make an ideal combination. To a meal composed
largely of rice and potatoes, which are deficient in
fats, there may be added a little cream, a few ripe olives,
a few nuts, or an egg, to give a well balanced ration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">Pg 78</a></span></p>

<p>The custom of eating a light lunch at noon, and reserving
the heaviest meal for the close of the day, while actuated
to a great extent by seeming necessities, or convenience,
is not, as a rule, found a benefit to health. As
a result of a hearty meal at night, the digestive process
is continued through the sleeping hours; and though the
stomach works constantly, its work is not properly accomplished.
The sleep is often disturbed by unpleasant
dreams; and in the morning, the person awakes unrefreshed,
and with little relish for breakfast.</p>

<p>The practice of eating but two meals a day is generally
found a benefit to health; yet under some circumstances,
persons may require a third meal. This should,
however, if taken at all, be very light, and of foods very
easily digested, so that when we lie down to rest, the
stomach may have its work all done, and it, as well as the
other organs of the body, may enjoy rest.</p>

<p>In the following menus, some allowance is made for
variety. Some persons will not require everything named
on the menu; and each person will choose such things,
and in such amounts, as experience and sound judgment
prove to be best suited to his own necessities.</p>

</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">Pg 79</a></span></p>

<p><i>Steamed Rice.</i>&mdash;Wash one cup of natural brown rice, and
put to cook in three cups of boiling water. Let boil gently
until the water is absorbed and the rice looks dry; then set
on the edge of the stove, well covered, to steam for fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p><i>Cream Peas on Toast.</i>&mdash;One cup drained green peas, one
third cup water, three tablespoonfuls rich cream, salt. Bring
the water and the peas to a boil, mash through a colander to
remove the hulls, and season with cream and salt. Dip a
slice of zwieback into hot milk to soften, lay on a platter, cover
with a spoonful of the cream of peas, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Corn Bread.</i>&mdash;One and one third cups corn meal, two tablespoonfuls
whole wheat flour, two and one half tablespoonfuls
vegetable butter, two tablespoonfuls brown sugar, one and one
fourth teaspoonfuls salt, one and one third cups boiling water,
two eggs. Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl. Add the
butter, and pour on the boiling water in a <i>slow</i> stream, stirring
while it is being poured in. Add two or three tablespoonfuls
of cold water if needed to make a medium batter. Separate the
eggs, and beat the whites stiff. Beat the yolks, and fold them
into the whites. Add the corn mixture, and mix, using the
folding motion. Pour into an oiled shallow baking pan, and
bake in a quick oven.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>Butter Substitutes</i></p>

<p>Owing to the great increase in disease among animals, and
along with this, the advance in prices of nearly all foodstuffs,
a desire has been created for some substitute for dairy butter,
which would prove both wholesome and appetizing. The following
butter substitutes are now used to some extent both
for cooking and for table use, and are easily prepared:</p>

<p><i>Emulsified Vegetable Oil.</i>&mdash;Secure a high grade cottonseed,
corn, or peanut oil. Beat one egg slightly, then add the
oil in a very slow stream at first, beating continuously, and increase
as the egg takes up the oil. Add two teaspoonfuls
lemon juice, then more oil, until three cupfuls have been used,
and the mixture is smooth and thick. Salt to taste, put into
a well covered jar, and use the same as butter.</p>

<p><i>Vegetable Butter.</i>&mdash;Take three cupfuls of any good coconut
product on the market, such as kokofat or kaola, or a
good brand of hydrogenated vegetable fat, as crisco.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">A</a> Add
the juice of half a lemon, salt to taste, and a few drops of
vegetable butter color. Mix with a spoon until the color of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">Pg 80</a></span>
dairy butter. The juice from carrots, grated and pressed,
may be used instead of the lemon juice and the butter color
if desired.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">A</span></a> <span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The presence of a proprietary substance in a recipe must not be understood
as guarantee by the authors. We know very little regarding the manufacture
of the above named products; but we have reason to believe they are wholesome,
and contain no animal products.</p>
</div>

<p>In harmony with the recent food pledge, saying, "Use no
butter in cooking," all the recipes in these menus are prepared
without the use of dairy butter. However, the same
recipes may be prepared with dairy butter instead of the
vegetable fats if so desired.</p>

<p><i>Beans with Noodles.</i>&mdash;Wash one cup navy or Lima beans,
add three cups water and a little salt, and let boil gently until
tender. Beat one egg slightly, with two teaspoonfuls of water
or milk and a pinch of salt. Add one cup of pastry flour, or
enough to make a stiff dough. Knead well, and divide into
two pieces. Roll out into thin sheets about the thickness of
paper, having the dough well floured. Let dry a few minutes,
then cut into strips about two inches wide. Lay in tiers, and
shred very fine with a sharp knife. Drain the liquid from the
beans, add to it enough water to make three cups of liquid, and
add salt to taste. Add two teaspoonfuls of vegetable butter,
and bring to a boil. Sprinkle the noodles into the boiling
broth, and let cook gently for fifteen minutes. Add the cooked
beans, and shake together, reheat, and serve. New peas may
be substituted for beans when in season.</p>

<p><i>Corn on Cob.</i>&mdash;Husk full ears of corn, and brush off the
silks with a stiff brush. Wash, and drop into boiling water to
which has been added a little milk or lemon juice. Bring to a
good boil; then draw the saucepan to one side of the stove,
and let simmer for twenty minutes.</p>

<p><i>Entire Wheat Bread.</i>&mdash;Three cups warm water, one half
cake compressed yeast, three tablespoonfuls brown sugar, two
tablespoonfuls vegetable fat, one tablespoonful salt, seven cups
entire wheat flour. Dissolve the yeast in two teaspoonfuls
of water, add the liquid, and mix all the ingredients to a
medium <i>soft</i> dough. Turn out on a slightly floured board,
and knead until elastic to the touch; then return to an oiled
bowl, cover, and let stand in a warm room to rise until, when
tapped sharply, it <i>begins</i> to sink (about two hours). Work
down well, turn over in the bowl, and let rest until it begins
to rise again (about fifteen minutes); then mold into loaves,
and put into pans for baking. Brush over the top of each loaf
with an oiled brush, and let rise until half again its original
bulk; then bake in a good oven. These coarse breads must be
watched closer during the rising than those made from white
flour, as they get light in much less time.</p>

<p><i>Creamed Rice.</i>&mdash;Heat some milk in a double boiler, and
when it is hot, add enough cooked rice to have it creamy, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">Pg 81</a></span>
not too soft. Add a pinch of salt, and a little rich cream, if
you have it at hand, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Corn Meal Crisps.</i>&mdash;One cup white corn meal, one cup pastry
flour, one half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful brown
sugar, two tablespoonfuls vegetable fat, scant one half cup
water. Mix all the dry ingredients, add the oil, and rub
between the hands to distribute the fat through the grain.
Add the water, and mix to a dough. Roll out to a thickness
of one fourth of an inch, cut with a biscuit cutter, prick with
a fork, and bake in a hot oven, to a light brown.</p>

<p><i>Zwieback.</i>&mdash;Cut stale bread into slices about one half inch
thick. Lay these in a baking pan, and put them into the
warming oven until the moisture is evaporated; then put
them into a hot oven until they are a light brown all the way
through.</p>

<li class="isub1">&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Steamed Pearl Barley.</i>&mdash;Wash one cup pearl barley, and
put to cook in four cups boiling water. Add one fourth teaspoonful
salt, and let boil gently until the water is absorbed
and the grain looks dry; then cover, and set on the edge of the
stove to steam for forty minutes. This grain is preferably
cooked on a hot stone in the fireless.</p>

<p><i>Scrambled Egg with New Tomato.</i>&mdash;Rub a large ripe tomato
with the back of a knife; then remove the skin, and
cut the tomato into pieces. Put it into a small pan, with one
teaspoonful vegetable butter and a pinch of salt, and bring
to a boil. Break two eggs slightly with a fork, put them into
a hot oiled frying pan, and stir until they are soft scrambled.
Have the tomato drained, add the pulp to the scrambled eggs,
and mix, being careful not to cook the egg too much. Serve
on toast.</p>

<p><i>Wheat Puffs.</i>&mdash;One and one fourth cups sifted pastry flour,
one fourth cup whole wheat flour, two teaspoonfuls melted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">Pg 82</a></span>
vegetable butter, one fourth teaspoon salt, one cup milk, one
egg. Make a batter of the flour, the salt, the milk, the egg
yolk, and the butter, and stir smooth. Beat the white stiff,
and pour the batter into the beaten white, mixing as it is
being poured in, and using the folding motion, so as not to
break down the lightness of the egg. Pour into hot oiled iron
gem pans, and bake in a quick oven.</p>

<p><i>Stewed Prunes.</i>&mdash;Wash dried prunes thoroughly, and let
them soak overnight. Then bring them to a boil, and let
simmer for two hours or more, and they will need no sweetening.</p>

<p><i>Farmer's Favorite Soup.</i>&mdash;One half cup rich sour cream,
one third cup macaroni, one small onion, one stalk celery, one
small carrot, one medium sized potato, chopped parsley, salt.
Drop the macaroni into three cupfuls boiling salted water, and
cook until thoroughly done. Have the vegetables cut into
small dice. Put the cream into a small pan, and stir over the
fire until the oil separates, and the albumen turns a light
brown color. The degree of browning determines the flavor
of the soup. Add the diced onion, carrot, and celery, and stir
for a few moments. Add three cupfuls water, the diced potato,
and a little salt, and cook until the vegetables are
thoroughly done. Add the macaroni water to the vegetable
soup; then lay the macaroni on a board, cut into small rings,
and drop into the soup. Boil up well, add chopped parsley,
and serve.</p>

<p><i>Roasted Potato.</i>&mdash;Peel eight medium sized potatoes, and
boil until they are about half done; then drain them, and save
the water. Lay the potatoes in an oiled baking pan, brush with
oil, sprinkle with salt and flour, and put into a hot oven to
brown.</p>

<p><i>Baked Dressing.</i>&mdash;Two cups soaked stale bread, one half
cup milk, three tablespoonfuls chopped onion, one and one half
tablespoonfuls vegetable butter, three tablespoonfuls browned
flour, a pinch of sage and marjoram, and salt to taste. Soak
the bread in cold water until it is soft all the way through,
then press it out. Put the butter, the onion, and the savory
into a small pan, and let them simmer for a few moments, to
soften the onion, but do not brown. Add the brown flour, then
the milk, and stir smooth. Add the bread, salt to taste, and
mix. Bake in an oiled brick tin, or spread among the roasted
potatoes when they are partly browned, and finish baking
them together.</p>

<p><i>Egg Gravy.</i>&mdash;Two tablespoonfuls vegetable fat, one teaspoonful
chopped onion, three tablespoonfuls flour, one egg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">Pg 83</a></span>
one and one half cups potato water or almost any vegetable
broth. Put the oil into a frying pan, and when it is quite hot,
add the whole egg. Break the yolk with a fork, turn it over,
and stir until brown over the entire surface. Remove the
brown egg from the oil, and chop with a knife. Add the flour
to the oil, and stir until a light brown. Add the onion, and
stir; then the chopped egg and one third of the water, and stir
smooth. Add the balance of the water, and boil up. Let
simmer for ten minutes, and serve. The egg may be omitted,
if desired; but without it, the gravy will have less flavor.</p>

<p><i>Spinach.</i>&mdash;Wash the greens in several waters. If the
spinach is young and tender, it can be cooked with no additional
water beyond that remaining on the leaves after washing.
As the spinach ages, it absorbs bitter flavor, and should
then be cooked in boiling water, with the <i>cover off</i>. When
done, drain, cut with a knife, season with salt and a little
vegetable butter, reheat, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Rye Bread.</i>&mdash;Two cups warm water, one half cake compressed
yeast, one and one half tablespoonfuls vegetable fat,
two tablespoonfuls brown sugar, two teaspoonfuls salt, four
cups white bread flour, three cups rye flour. Dissolve the
yeast in two teaspoonfuls water, add the liquid, and beat in
three cups best bread flour to a smooth batter. Cover, and
let stand in a warm room to rise for one and one half hours.
Add the salt, the sugar, and the oil, and beat into the sponge.
Mix in the rye flour and the remaining cup of white flour, to
a medium dough. Knead on a board until elastic to the touch,
then return to an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise the same as for
entire wheat bread, in Sunday's lesson. When ready to mold
into loaves, roll out six buns, and lay on an oiled pie tin, and
let rise for <i>rye biscuit</i>. Divide the remaining dough into
two parts, and roll out into the shape of ordinary rye bread
loaves. Lay in an oiled baking pan, leaving space between.
Brush with an oiled brush, and cut three gashes across each
loaf with a sharp knife, and let rise until light, then bake in
a quick oven.</p>

<p><i>Baked Banana.</i>&mdash;Select firm, rather ripe bananas, put them
into the oven without removing the skins, and bake until the
skins burst. Then remove from the oven, and serve in a
folded napkin.</p>

<p><i>Tomato Sandwiches.</i>&mdash;Peel ripe tomatoes without scalding,
by first scraping them with the back of a knife; then cut into
thin slices. Cut bread into very thin slices, and spread one
slice with butter, and the opposite slice with mayonnaise or
boiled dressing. Lay tomatoes between the slices, cut in triangles,
and serve.</p>

<li class="isub1">&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Savory Hash.</i>&mdash;Two cups cold boiled potatoes cut in dice,
three fourths cup of the baked dressing as given in Monday's
lesson, cold, and cut into small dice, one and one half tablespoonfuls
diced onion, one and one half tablespoonfuls vegetable
butter, one tablespoonful brown flour, a pinch of sage or
marjoram, one half cup milk, and salt to taste. Put the butter,
the onion, and the savory into a small pan, and simmer for a
few moments; then add the brown flour and a little of the
milk, and stir smooth. Add the balance of the milk, and boil
up. Salt to taste, and add the diced food. Sprinkle the diced
potato with a little salt, add the gravy mixture, and mix with
a fork. Put into an oiled baking pan, brush over the top with
a little cream, and bake in a hot oven to a nice brown.</p>

<p><i>Jellied Egg.</i>&mdash;Put one pint of water into a small, narrow
saucepan, and bring to a boil. Drop in one egg with a spoon,
and set the saucepan immediately on the table for from seven
to eight minutes; then serve. If more eggs are added, the
amount of water must be increased proportionately.</p>

<p><i>Corn Dodgers.</i>&mdash;One cup corn meal (preferably toasted
lightly in the oven), one and one half tablespoonfuls vegetable
fat, one half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful brown sugar,
one and one half cups boiling water. Mix all the dry ingredients,
add the fat and pour on the boiling water and stir
smooth. A few more tablespoonfuls water may be added if
needed to make a batter of such a consistency as to drop from
a spoon, but not run. Drop from the side of a spoon, onto an
oiled baking pan, and bake in a quick oven.</p>

<p><i>Corn Cake.</i>&mdash;Use the above recipe, and spread in an oiled
baking pan one fourth inch deep, and bake in a hot oven.</p>

<p><i>New England Dinner.</i>&mdash;Six medium small potatoes, four
small carrots, four small turnips, six small onions, one half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">Pg 85</a></span>
small cabbage, one and one half tablespoonfuls vegetable butter,
and salt to taste. Quarter the peeled turnips and carrots.
Add the onions whole, and put into a saucepan with water
enough to cover the vegetables, and salt, and bring to a boil.
Separate the cabbage leaves, and drop them into another vessel
of boiling water, to blanch them for five minutes; then
drain, and add to the boiling vegetables. Add the potatoes,
and let boil gently until nearly done; then add the vegetable
butter, and let simmer until thoroughly done.</p>

<p><i>Cream Rice Pudding.</i>&mdash;One half cup uncooked white rice,
five cupfuls milk, scant one third cup sugar, vanilla flavor.
Wash the rice thoroughly, add the milk, and cook in a double
boiler for three fourths of an hour. Add the sugar and the
vanilla flavor, and pour into an oiled baking pan and bake in
a moderate oven. As soon as the first crust forms, stir it
down, at the same time stirring the rice. Then allow the last
crust to form and brown, and remove from the oven.</p>

<p><i>Milk Toast.</i>&mdash;Put a piece of zwieback into a bowl, pour
scalding hot milk over it, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Raisin Sandwich.</i>&mdash;Chop one half cup seeded raisins fine,
and add one fourth cup ground walnuts. Add one and one
half tablespoonfuls mayonnaise dressing and one teaspoonful
lemon juice, and mix well. Spread between slices of thinly
buttered bread, cut in triangles, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Rye Wafers.</i>&mdash;One cup rye flour, one cup pastry flour, two
and one half tablespoonfuls vegetable fat, two tablespoonfuls
brown sugar, one half teaspoonful salt, one half cup water,
or barely enough to mix to a stiff dough. Mix all the dry ingredients,
add the oil, and rub the flour between the hands to
distribute the oil evenly. Add the water very slowly, stirring
meantime to avoid getting any part of the flour wet and
sticky. Work on the board until mixed, then roll out to one
fourth inch thickness, cut with a biscuit cutter, prick with a
fork, and bake in a hot oven to a light brown.</p>

<p><i>Rye Sticks.</i>&mdash;Take the above dough, roll out one half inch
thick, cut into long strips about one third inch wide, then
crosswise into three-inch lengths. Lay in a baking pan, leaving
a little space between, and bake to a light brown color.</p>

<li class="isub1">&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Steamed Wheat.</i>&mdash;Pick over one cup of wheat, and wash in
several waters. Let soak overnight; then drain, add four cups
boiling water, and let boil slowly until the water is evaporated
and the wheat looks dry. Cover, and let stand on the edge of
the stove to steam for forty minutes. This grain is best
cooked on a hot stone in fireless overnight.</p>

<p><i>Plain Omelet.</i>&mdash;One egg, one tablespoonful milk, a pinch of
salt. Beat the yolk until thick, add the milk, and mix well.
Add a pinch of salt to the white, and beat stiff. Fold the yolk
into the white, and pour the mixture into a hot oiled fry pan,
and set into the oven until just barely <i>set</i>. While still in the
pan, turn one half of the omelet over the other half, by slipping
a knife under one side and turning it over on the other
section. Invert on a hot platter, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Corn Meal Puffs.</i>&mdash;One cup pastry flour, one third cup
corn meal, one half teaspoonful salt, two teaspoonfuls vegetable
butter, one scant cup milk, one egg separated. Make a
batter of the milk, the flour, the corn meal, the salt, the melted
fat, and the egg yolk, and stir smooth. Beat the white stiff,
and fold the batter into it. Pour into hot oiled iron gem pans,
and bake in a quick oven.</p>

<p><i>Vegetable Julienne Soup.</i>&mdash;One medium small potato, one
small carrot, one small turnip, one stalk celery, one half cup
cauliflowerlets or string beans, peas, or any fresh green vegetable,
one small tomato, one teaspoonful vegetable butter, two
cups cold water, two cups vegetable broth, salt to taste. Cut
all the coarse vegetables into very thin shreds, and put into a
small pan with the vegetable butter and one fourth cup water,
and let simmer until the moisture is absorbed; then add the
rest of the water, and boil up. Add the cut potato and tomato
and the vegetable broth. Salt to taste, and let cook until the
vegetables are thoroughly done. Add a sprinkle of chopped
parsley, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Macaroni Family Style.</i>&mdash;One cup macaroni raw, one cup
tomato pulp, one tablespoonful vegetable butter, one tablespoonful
chopped onion, a sprinkle of sage or thyme, one egg, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">Pg 87</a></span>
salt to taste. Break the macaroni into inch lengths, drop into
salted boiling water, and let cook until thoroughly done; then
drain in a colander. Put the butter, the onion, and the savory
into a small pan, and simmer for a few moments, but do not
brown. Add the tomato, bring to a boil, and salt to taste.
Pour the hot sauce into the egg, stirring as it is being poured
in. Add the cooked macaroni, pour all into an oiled baking
pan, and bake to a light brown.</p>

<p><i>String Beans.</i>&mdash;Select young and tender beans, string them,
and break them into short lengths. Wash, and lift them out
of the water; put into a saucepan with enough boiling water to
cover the beans. Add salt, and let cook gently, having the
cover drawn to one side of the saucepan. When done, add a
little vegetable butter and serve. When the beans are aged,
they should be lifted out of the water and put into a covered
vessel containing a little hot vegetable oil, and stirred over the
fire for ten minutes before the water is added to them; and
when cooked, they will be very tender.</p>

<p><i>Raised Corn Bread.</i>&mdash;In order to incorporate in corn bread
enough moisture so that it will not dry out after baking, a
certain proportion of the liquid used may be poured over the
meal boiling hot; thus the needed moisture is absorbed before
making into bread, as follows:</p>

<p>Three cups water, one half cake compressed yeast, four
cups best bread flour, two cups corn meal, one tablespoon salt,
three tablespoons sugar, two tablespoons vegetable fat. Sift
the flour into a large bowl, and leave space at one side of the
flour for the sponge. Dissolve the yeast in two teaspoons
water, add one cup warm water, and pour on one side of the
flour. Stir enough flour into this liquid to make a thin, smooth
batter. Cover, and set in a warm room until light (about one
and one half hours). Put the corn meal into a small bowl,
and pour on gradually, in a slow stream, two cups boiling
water, stirring as it is poured in, and let stand one half hour.</p>

<p>When the sponge is sufficiently light, add the salt, the
sugar, and the vegetable fat, and mix well. Add the scalded
and warm corn meal, and mix all into a soft dough. Turn
out on a floured board, and knead until elastic to the touch.
Then return to an oiled bowl, cover, let rise, and finish the
same as for entire wheat bread.</p>

<p><i>Wheat Gruel.</i>&mdash;Take the steamed wheat left over from
breakfast, add water to cover, and let cook gently until well
done. Mash through a strainer, season with salt and a little
cream or canned milk, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Rye Sticks.</i>&mdash;The recipe for rye sticks is given following
the recipe for rye wafers in Tuesday's lesson.</p>

<p><i>Grano Cereal.</i>&mdash;Two cups pastry flour, one third cup rolled
oats, one fourth cup corn meal, one fourth teaspoonful salt,
large one half cup water. Mix all the dry ingredients, and
add the water slowly, stirring constantly to a very stiff dough.
Knead a few moments, then roll out one fourth inch thick.
Cut into strips about three inches wide, prick with a fork, lay
in a baking pan, and bake in a medium oven until a very light
brown and fairly crisp. When cool, grind through a food
chopper, using a coarse knife. Serve with milk or cream.</p>

<p><i>Grano with Dates.</i>&mdash;Two cups water, one cup grano cereal,
one half cup washed and pitted dates, a pinch of salt. Bring
the water to a boil, and sprinkle in the grano. Stir until
thick, then add the dates, and serve with cream.</p>

<p><i>Baked Garbanzos (chick peas).</i>&mdash;Wash one cup garbanzos,
and soak overnight. Drain, add two cups boiling water, and
let boil gently until thoroughly done, or cook in fireless overnight.
Return to the fire, add salt to taste, and let cook gently
until the liquid is reduced; then put into the oven in a covered
dish, and bake until they begin to brown slightly on the bottom.</p>

<p><i>Navy Bean Soup Army Style.</i>&mdash;One cup navy beans, seven
cups water, two thirds cup diced carrot, one third cup diced
onion, one tablespoonful vegetable butter, salt to taste. Wash
the beans, and cook very slowly until tender, adding the salt
when they are about half done. Put the butter, the diced
carrot, and the onion into a small pan with three tablespoonfuls
water, and stir over the fire until the water is absorbed;
then add to the bean soup, and let boil gently for thirty minutes
or more. Add a sprinkle of chopped parsley, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Stewed Carrots.</i>&mdash;Two cups sliced young carrots, one and
one half cups hot water, two teaspoonfuls vegetable butter,
one teaspoon flour, salt. Wash and scrape young carrots, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">Pg 89</a></span>
slice quite thin. Add the hot water, and salt to taste, and let
cook gently until the liquid is reduced to one half cup. Rub
the flour and the butter smooth in a small pan. Add one third
of the liquid, and stir smooth. Add the balance of the liquid,
and boil up. Add the carrots, reheat, and serve. A little rich
cream or canned milk may be added if desired.</p>

<p><i>Noodles au Gratin.</i>&mdash;Roll out and cut noodles the same as
given in recipe for Sunday dinner. Sprinkle into boiling
salted water, and cook the same as macaroni, or about fifteen
minutes. Drain well, saving the liquid for gravies or sauces.
Make a cream sauce by rubbing together in a saucepan two
tablespoonfuls vegetable butter and two tablespoonfuls flour;
then add one third cup hot milk, and stir smooth. Add two
thirds cup more milk, boil up, and salt to taste. Add enough
of the cream sauce to the noodles to flavor them and not have
them too soft. Pour into an oiled baking pan, and grate fresh
bread crumbs over the top, pressing them down with a spoon
to moisten them. Sprinkle with cream or bits of butter, and
bake to a nice brown.</p>

<p><i>Steamed Raisins.</i>&mdash;Dip cluster raisins into water, drain,
and lay between two pie tins; put into the oven until hot
through; then serve.</p>

<p><i>Banana Rice.</i>&mdash;Take the recipe for creamed rice as given
in the lesson for Sunday evening luncheon. Slice one large
banana, sprinkle with a little sugar, mix lightly into the hot
creamed rice, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Nut and Jelly Sandwiches.</i>&mdash;Add finely chopped or ground
walnuts to jelly in the proportion to spread nicely on bread.
Cut bread into very thin slices. Spread one slice with butter,
and the opposite slice with the nut mixture. Fold together,
cut in triangles, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Buckwheat Sticks.</i>&mdash;One cup pastry flour, one cup buckwheat
flour, one half teaspoonful salt, two and one half tablespoonfuls
vegetable fat, two tablespoonfuls brown sugar, scant
one half cup water, or barely enough to mix the flour to a stiff
dough. Mix all the dry ingredients, add the fat, and rub between
hands to distribute the oil evenly. Add the water very
slowly, stirring meantime; and as soon as the flour can be
worked together by sufficient moisture, lay on the board, and
work for a few moments; then roll out to one third inch thickness.
Cut into strips one third inch in width, then crosswise
into sticks three inches long. Lay in a baking pan, leaving
a little space between, and bake to a very light brown.</p>

<p><i>Buckwheat Wafers.</i>&mdash;Take the above dough, roll out one
fourth inch thick, cut with a biscuit cutter, prick with a fork,
and bake the same as sticks.</p>

</ul>

<p><i>Corn Meal with Raisins.</i>&mdash;Wash one half cup raisins, and
put them between two pie tins in the oven until hot through.
Put one cup corn meal into a baking pan, and toast lightly in
the oven; then sprinkle it gradually into three and one half
cupfuls of boiling water, with one fourth teaspoonful salt, and
let cook gently for ten minutes. Add the raisins, let cook for
twenty minutes more, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Poached Egg.</i>&mdash;Bring water to a boil in a saucepan, break
the egg into a separate dish, and drop carefully into the boiling
water. Set immediately to one side of the stove until the egg
is firm enough to remove, and the white will be tender and
jellylike.</p>

<p><i>Cream of Tomato Soup.</i>&mdash;Two cupfuls strained tomato, one
cupful water, two teaspoonfuls vegetable butter, one tablespoonful
light brown flour, one cupful canned milk or rich
cream, salt to taste. Bring the water, the tomato, and the
butter to a boil. Thicken with the flour made smooth with a
little cold water. Salt to taste, add canned milk (unheated),
strain, and serve. If cream is used, omit the butter.</p>

<p><i>Vegetable Loaf.</i>&mdash;One and one half cups soaked stale bread,
three fourths cup cooked and left-over food (brown beans
preferred), one and one half tablespoonfuls vegetable butter,
two teaspoonfuls chopped onion, a sprinkle of sage and marjoram,
one tablespoonful brown flour, one third cup milk, one
egg, and salt to taste. Soak the bread in cold water until soft
all the way through; then press out lightly. Put the butter,
the onion, and the savory into a small pan, and simmer for a
few moments. Add the brown flour, then the milk, and stir
until smooth. Mash the beans with a spoon, beat the egg
slightly, and mix all the ingredients. Bake in an oiled baking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">Pg 91</a></span>
pan until set, and brown on the top. Loosen with a knife
along the edge, turn out on a platter, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Country Gravy.</i>&mdash;Cook down a little sour cream in a pan
until the oil separates and the albumen turns a very light
brown color; then add enough flour (previously browned in the
oven) to take up the fat from the cream. Add a little hot
milk, and stir smooth. Add more milk, and bring to a boil
and the thickness of medium thin gravy.</p>

<p><i>Stewed Corn.</i>&mdash;Take cooked corn cut off the cob, add a little
hot water, and bring to a boil. Season with a little cream or
vegetable butter, reheat, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Fruit Soup.</i>&mdash;Two cups blackberry or strawberry juice,
four tablespoonfuls sago, two teaspoonfuls lemon juice, two
cups water, sugar to taste. Wash the sago, drain, add to two
cups boiling water, and let cook until clear. Add the fruit
juices, and sweeten to taste. Preferably served cold.</p>

<p><i>Cream Hominy.</i>&mdash;Heat a little cream, or a little milk and
a small seasoning of vegetable butter. Add enough lye hominy
to make the food creamy and not too milky. Add a pinch of
salt, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Soy Toast.</i>&mdash;Duplicate the recipe for cream peas on toast,
as given in Sunday's breakfast lesson, substituting thoroughly
cooked and mashed soy beans for the peas, and serve.</p>

<p><i>Whole Rice with Peas.</i>&mdash;One half cup uncooked natural
brown rice, one and one half cups boiling water, one and one
half cups cooked new peas, one tablespoonful vegetable butter,
two teaspoonfuls flour, salt. Wash the rice thoroughly, put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">Pg 92</a></span>
to cook in one and one half cups boiling water, and let boil
steadily until the water is evaporated and the rice looks dry;
then cover, and let stand on the edge of the stove to steam for
fifteen minutes. Add enough hot water to the peas to cover
them, salt to season, and let cook gently until the liquid is
reduced to one half cupful, and the peas are tender. Rub the
flour and the butter together in a saucepan. Add a little of
the liquid from the peas, and stir smooth. Add the balance of
the liquid, and boil up. Add the peas to the rice, pour on the
thin sauce, and mix with a fork. Put into a covered dish, and
set into the oven until hot through.</p>

<p><i>Summer Squash.</i>&mdash;Wash the squash, peel very thinly, remove
the seeds if they are large, and steam the squash until
tender. Mash, season with a little cream or vegetable butter,
and serve.</p>

<p><i>Raisin Pie.</i>&mdash;One and one half cupfuls seedless sultana
raisins, two cupfuls water, one tablespoonful lemon juice, one
scant tablespoonful cornstarch, one third cup sugar, one teaspoonful
vegetable butter. Wash the raisins thoroughly, and
soak overnight. Bring to a boil with the two cupfuls water;
then add the sugar mixed with the starch, a pinch of salt, and
let boil for about ten minutes, or until the liquid is reduced
suitably for one pie. Let cool.</p>

<p><i>Pie Crust.</i>&mdash;One and one fourth cups pastry flour, four
tablespoonfuls solid vegetable fat, one eighth teaspoonful salt,
about three tablespoonfuls water. Add the salt and the shortening
to the flour, and mix with the finger tips. Add the water
very slowly, mixing with a fork, as it runs in, to a soft, light
dough. Line the bottom of a pie tin with crust, being careful
to press the crust well down into the tin; then pour on the
stewed raisins. Add the lemon juice and the vegetable butter;
then cover with a perforated top crust, having the edges wet,
so as to stick the crusts together. Brush over the top with
milk, and bake in a quick oven.</p>

<p><i>Cream Rolls.</i>&mdash;One and one third cups pastry flour, two
thirds cup whole wheat flour, one half teaspoonful salt, one
teaspoonful sugar, one third cup double cream, one fourth
cup cold water. Mix the water and the cream thoroughly.
Put all the dry ingredients into a bowl, and pour on the wetting
in a very slow stream, stirring constantly, so as to get
the moisture evenly blended through the flour. Work into a
dough, roll out to about one half inch thickness, and cut into
long strips about one third inch in width. Roll each piece on
the board, and cut into three-inch lengths. Lay in a baking
pan, leaving a little space between, and bake in a medium oven,
to a light brown.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="use"></a><i>The</i> USE <i>of</i> LEFT-OVERS</h2>

</div>

<p class="center bold large"><i>by<br />
Dr. LAVINA BAXTER-HERZER</i><br />
<br />
Department of Pathology and Bacteriology,<br />
College of Medical Evangelists,<br />
Loma Linda, California</p>

<p>At the present time, when the conservation of food
is such a vital question, the use of left-overs becomes a
very important matter for consideration. The following
are a few simple suggestions that may prove helpful.</p>

<p>First of all, we should plan, as far as possible, to
avoid having much food left. One of the simplest means
of accomplishing this is to serve fewer foods at a meal.
Variety may be had at different meals.</p>

<p>By planning beforehand, we can serve such foods at
one meal as will combine nicely when warmed the next
day or the next meal.</p>

<p>For example: In all large hotels, when navy bean soup
is served army style, carrots are always served in some
way. In order to make the broth sufficiently rich, more
beans are cooked than are served as soup. The next day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">Pg 94</a></span>
these, with the carrots, are put through a soup strainer,
properly seasoned, and served as puree a la Crecy.</p>

<p>Again, when planning tomato rice soup, cook a little
extra rice in the tomato broth. When serving the soup,
use only what rice is necessary. The thick remainder is
very good baked in some acceptable preparation the next
day. A little grated onion or a chopped bell pepper may
be used for seasoning, if desired.</p>


<hr class="style1" />
<p class="center bold large"><i>A Housewife's Test</i></p>

<p>After meals, the first thing that should claim the
housewife's attention is the food that remains uneaten.
Just here is one of the tests of her ability to do her part
in conserving her family food supply. It is quicker, perhaps,
to scrape everything into the garbage pail; and it
is said that at least twenty per cent of all foods brought
into American kitchens is lost in this way. This loss
either decreases the amount of food the family should
have, or raises the cost of living that much.</p>

<p>If food is to be kept over, it should be put into dishes
of proper size, and put in a cool place, away from the
flies and the dust. The sooner these left-overs are used,
the better, as they naturally deteriorate by standing.</p>

<p>In case of fresh fruit, it may be heated, if there is
any doubt as to its keeping.</p>

<p>Apple peelings and cores make excellent jelly, as most
of the pectin is found near the skin and the seeds. Care
should be taken to wash the apples well before paring,
and remove any wormy parts.</p>

<p>All butter scraps should be saved, and may be used
for cooking. If the family is properly taught, however,
there will be very little left on the plates.</p>

<p>Left-over bread may be used for toast, bread pudding,
or pressed fruit pudding, if unbroken. The broken pieces
and the crumbs may be dried and used for dressing, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">Pg 95</a></span>
broken or rolled and served with milk instead of fresh
bread.</p>

<p>Buns, muffins, and gems may be moistened and reheated.
A loaf of very stale bread may be freshened in
the same way.</p>

<p>Left-over vegetables may be reheated, and used for
salad, or for flavoring soups, if put through a soup
strainer.</p>

<p>Salads do not keep well; and for that reason, care
should be taken not to prepare more than is likely to be
eaten. If a little is left, it may be used for a pick-up
lunch, perhaps. Small portions of dessert may be used
in the same way.</p>

<p>Milk or cream that is left may be sterilized and put
in a cool place.</p>

<p>Left-over grains may be used for making gruels, which
are very good for lunch; or if only a small amount remains,
it may be used for thickening soup. If there is
a sufficient amount, steamed raisins or dates may be
added, and then it may be put into molds to cool. This
may be served with cream or some pudding sauce, making
a simple dessert for either dinner or lunch. Cream
of wheat, rolled wheat, farina, and Graham are especially
nice served in this way.</p>

<p>Many housewives cook an extra amount of corn meal
in order to have some left, as it is better warmed up than
at the first. It is good mixed with croutons, rolled in
corn flakes, browned, and served with jelly or maple sirup.
To mix with rice or any nut food, season, form into patties,
and serve with tomato sauce, is another method.</p>

<p>When warming potatoes, if the supply is scant, many
persons add a slice of stale bread broken up.</p>

<p>The vegetable loaf given in Mr. Anderson's recipes
may be varied, and any kind of beans or peas used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">Pg 96</a></span>
make it. Served with a good gravy, it makes a substantial
dish for dinner.</p>

<p>By using a choux paste, left-over rice, macaroni, spaghetti,
any kind of beans, peas, or lentils may be made
into patties or croquettes. They may be served with
gravy or jelly, and their original form scarcely be recognized
when they appear on the table next time.</p>

<p>To make the choux paste, take one and one half tablespoons
of butter, dairy or vegetable, one tablespoon of
chopped onion, and a pinch of sage. Put in a small saucepan,
and stir over the fire a few minutes, but do not
brown. Add three tablespoons of flour, and stir until it
is thoroughly scalded. Then add one third cup of milk,
and stir until smooth. Drop into this mixture the yolk
of one egg, and stir until it is well cooked. It should be
a thick, smooth paste when done. Part of this may be
used one day, and the rest saved for another time.</p>

<p>As the housewife seeks to make use of all remnants
of food, new possibilities will gradually open before her,
and her efforts will become a real pleasure rather than a
task.</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> <a id="call"></a>call is, therefore, to YOU to do
your part; and in the doing, you will
bind yourself to the whole army of
women who are serving their country.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
